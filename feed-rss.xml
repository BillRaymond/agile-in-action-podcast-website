            <title>Let's talk about SAFe</title>
            <link>https://www.agileinaction.com/agile-in-action-podcast/2021/11/09/let-s-talk-about-safe.html</link>
            <description>Organizations that want to be more agile will often create small, autonomous teams that can deliver faster. The structure for those teams often looks similar to those defined by SCRUM. However, what happens when many SCRUM teams, maybe 20, 30, or more, need to work on coordinated release efforts? That is a problem the Scaled Agile Framework (or SAFe) may need to answer.</description>

            <description>Have you ever opened up an app that you love, just to be bothered by that one critical feature that hardly works, feels too slow, or is just frustrating to use? Chances are, the developers that wrote that code are all too aware of the problem. Maybe the code is too complex to fix without re-writing it, or perhaps their priorities shift to some other newer and shinier feature of the product. We call problems like this technical debt, and it is a growing problem that we must address.</description>

            <description>Product Lifecycle Management, especially for large and complex products like automobiles, is ripe for re-invention. Organizations adopt agile techniques and focus on smaller, more focused teams to deliver more competitive and customer-centric solutions at near breakneck speeds.</description>

            <title>Introducing Agile for Finance </title>
            <link>https://www.agileinaction.com/agile-in-action-podcast/2021/08/31/introducing-agile-for-finance.html</link>
            <description>As a researcher, Loreal Jiles has interviewed large and small organizations to learn the challenges and changes affecting finance. In doing that research, she discovered momentum to progress from data stewardship to value creation through deeper collaborations. Not surprisingly – especially given the pandemic – there is a significant shift to finance adapting to a fast pace of change.

With this change in mind, Loreal proposes that Finance organizations consider agility to react to change, scale for efficient operations, and empower multi-disciplinary teams.

In today’s podcast, Loreal shares examples of how agile can help finance teams streamline risk management, improve financial planning &amp; analysis functions, reduce the pain and increase the efficiency of internal audits, and much more.</description>

            <title>Agility, frameworks, and gaining a competitive advantage </title>
            <link>https://www.agileinaction.com/agile-in-action-podcast/2021/08/03/agility-frameworks-and-gaining-a-competitive-advantage-with-evan-leybourn.html</link>
            <description>Business agility represents the continuous and purposeful change you make to deliver more value to your customers and gain a competitive edge. Very often, we use frameworks that guide how to be more agile.
The list of frameworks is endless and full of acronyms, like SCRUM, XP, SaFe, and many more. It can be tempting to select a framework that looks good and start using it. However, there are downsides to that approach.</description>

            <title>A day in the life of a Product Manager</title>

            <description>Leadership may define business goals, but how does your product strategy align? Enter the role of a Product Manager.

Today, I speak to Albert Chen, a Senior Product Manager at Okta and an organizer at the San Francisco chapter of ProductTank. Albert shares his view of the role of a Product Manager, where they belong in the corporate structure, the deliverables they produce, and how they are going about defining markets.</description>
