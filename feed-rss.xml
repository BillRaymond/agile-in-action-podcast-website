            <link>https://www.agileinaction.com/agile-in-action-podcast/2022/01/25/setting-and-achieving-corporate-objectives-okrs.html</link>
            <description>In today’s podcast, I speak with Glenn Gow, The CEO Therapist and a CEO Coach. If your organization is unclear about its intended objectives, you will not achieve alignment. That misalignment can have tangible costs, such as not meeting revenue targets, reduced customer value, or reduced employee satisfaction. Glenn shares how CEOs and senior leaders should define measurable Objectives and Key Results. Glenn also shares how to align the organization to those OKRs and ensure accountability.</description>

            <description>Some of us love swirling in the abyss of the unknown, while others need direction, clarity, and specificity. Ambiguity can lead to behaviors that drive an organization to falter, lose its competitive edge, or lose disillusioned employees.</description>

            <description>Laura Pirro came to learn some agile concepts taking a course while at Ghent University. The course teacher said agile is primarily for software development and did not apply to R&amp;D. Laura decided to learn more about agile and found that R&amp;D projects could benefit from the ideas.</description>

            <description>Very often, we refer to agile as supporting a product-focused operating model. So, what is that operating model and what might it look like? Blake Bassett defines an operating model and then shares how you can consider creating your own. Blake shares how to consider building a model by using the following topic areas:</description>

            <description>Agile teams often think differently than more traditional project planning efforts. Gone are months-long project schedules with tasks, milestones, and resource plans. In place of that are autonomous teams that define a value-driven backlog of work, and they schedule that work in short iterations (or sprints) over 1-4 weeks.</description>

            <title>Let's talk about SAFe</title>
            <link>https://www.agileinaction.com/agile-in-action-podcast/2021/11/09/let-s-talk-about-safe.html</link>
            <description>Organizations that want to be more agile will often create small, autonomous teams that can deliver faster. The structure for those teams often looks similar to those defined by SCRUM. However, what happens when many SCRUM teams, maybe 20, 30, or more, need to work on coordinated release efforts? That is a problem the Scaled Agile Framework (or SAFe) may need to answer.</description>

            <description>Have you ever opened up an app that you love, just to be bothered by that one critical feature that hardly works, feels too slow, or is just frustrating to use? Chances are, the developers that wrote that code are all too aware of the problem. Maybe the code is too complex to fix without re-writing it, or perhaps their priorities shift to some other newer and shinier feature of the product. We call problems like this technical debt, and it is a growing problem that we must address.</description>

            <description>Product Lifecycle Management, especially for large and complex products like automobiles, is ripe for re-invention. Organizations adopt agile techniques and focus on smaller, more focused teams to deliver more competitive and customer-centric solutions at near breakneck speeds.</description>

            <title>Introducing Agile for Finance </title>
            <link>https://www.agileinaction.com/agile-in-action-podcast/2021/08/31/introducing-agile-for-finance.html</link>
            <description>As a researcher, Loreal Jiles has interviewed large and small organizations to learn the challenges and changes affecting finance. In doing that research, she discovered momentum to progress from data stewardship to value creation through deeper collaborations. Not surprisingly – especially given the pandemic – there is a significant shift to finance adapting to a fast pace of change.

With this change in mind, Loreal proposes that Finance organizations consider agility to react to change, scale for efficient operations, and empower multi-disciplinary teams.

In today’s podcast, Loreal shares examples of how agile can help finance teams streamline risk management, improve financial planning &amp; analysis functions, reduce the pain and increase the efficiency of internal audits, and much more.</description>
