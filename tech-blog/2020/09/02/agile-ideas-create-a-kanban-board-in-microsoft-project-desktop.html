<p>Microsoft Project may not be your typical agile project management tool, but here’s an interesting approach.</p>

<p>In my post, <a href="he-history-of-agile-and-project-management.html">An introduction to agile: The history of agile and project management</a>, I share how businesses are shifting from a traditional <em>waterfall</em> approach to an agile-based method for managing projects.</p>

<p>If you aren’t one for reading, I created a video lesson you can watch here:</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/3lG7vpXNyu0" title="https://youtu.be/3lG7vpXNyu0">https://youtu.be/3lG7vpXNyu0</a></p>

<p>The <em>waterfall</em> method assumes you plan all your work upfront, defining all the tasks, and linking them together into a perfect chain we call the <em>critical path</em>. In agile, you build a product backlog.</p>

<p>In most agile organizations, the product backlog is maintained by a role called the Product Owner. The teams doing the work manage a sprint backlog. The sprint backlog is a set of work the team prioritized for a sprint, which is very often a period of time between 1-3 weeks.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-the-kanban-board">Introducing the Kanban board</h2>

<p>A simple and intuitive way to manage work is to use a <em>Kanban board</em>, which, as you will see is a table with a set of columns.</p>

<p>The columns go from left-to-right, starting with a backlog of work (product backlog, sprint backlog, to-do list, etc.). When items in the backlog are in progress, you simply move them to different columns that show work progress until they are in the <em>done</em> (finished, completed, etc.) column.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-project-and-kanban">Microsoft Project and Kanban</h2>

<p>You would think that Microsoft Project, being a waterfall-based scheduling tool would not be useful for managing agile projects. To an extent, that is true, although the latest version of the Microsoft Project Online desktop version, does have a built-in <em>agile board</em> capability.</p>

<p>A common misperception in project management is that agile suggests teams <em>do what they want whenever they want</em>. That is not true and not a best practice. In fact, work should always have priorities and sometimes, we have to meet critical deadlines. Project Managers and Project Owners often want some semblance of a plan while still allowing teams to select the work they can do based on a set of priorities.</p>

<p>What all that means is that agile teams are free to select what they will do for a given sprint, but not necessarily pick and choose their favorite things from the entire backlog.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-project-the-hybrid-approach">Microsoft Project: The hybrid approach</h2>

<p><img src="/uploads/charging-station-logo-5261309_1280.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If you are in an organization where it is still important to plan a schedule, but also want to use agile techniques, then you are likely using a hybrid approach to managing the work. You are probably not creating a detailed critical path for every single work element in a plan, but you are still at least building timelines and using some form of a Kanban board.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier in this article, Microsoft Project Online (desktop) has the ability to create agile boards, but what if you do not have the online version or a previous version?</p>

<h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>

<p>With the approach I layout in this article, you will learn how to create a Kanban report using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Project 2013</li>
  <li>Microsoft Project 2016</li>
  <li>Microsoft Project 2019</li>
  <li>Project Online (desktop), but it would be duplicative since the built-in <em>agile board</em>  feature provides the same (and more) functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>Optionally, you can download a copy of my sample project. Donations are accepted, but you can just type $0 for a free version.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run Microsoft Project and create a new project or open your favorite project. I provide a sample</li>
  <li>Click on the report tab.</li>
  <li>Locate the View Reports section and click the New Report icon. A menu appears as shown in the next image. Select the Blank item.</li>
  <li>The Report Name dialog appears. Type Kanban Board.</li>
</ol>
