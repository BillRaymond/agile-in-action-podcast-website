        <content>Product Lifecycle Management, especially for large and complex products like automobiles, is ripe for re-invention. Organizations adopt agile techniques and focus on smaller, more focused teams to deliver more competitive and customer-centric solutions at near breakneck speeds.

Imagine building a car, for example. Tracking all the parts from vendors around the world would be hard enough. Now, imagine all the silicon and software in a modern car to manage everything from acceleration and breaking to climate controls and music. All that hardware and software have must work in unison, and you need to track all the parts and dependencies in a centralized database.

Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending on how you look at it), there is rarely no centralized database. Most organizations have multiple software products to manage parts, vendors, and software. That is where the Openness certification comes in, and Michael Hertwig is sharing how it works.</content>

In today’s podcast, I speak with Anthony Murphy, Director and founding member of the Association of Product Professionals. He shares how organizations and teams can define a winning product strategy. He also shares the differences between a vision, a strategy, and a roadmap.</content>

        <content>In today’s podcast, I have a lively discussion with David Pereira, Head of Product at Virtual Identity, who makes a bold proposal for a Product Manifesto.

David shares that while the Manifesto for Agile Software Development helped us change how we work, we now need a product manifesto to define how we deliver value.</content>

        <content>In our latest “Agile for…” series, we talk to Andrea Fryrear about Agile for Marketing. We discuss the unique structure of a marketing organization and the opportunities to reduce complexity and introduce agile methods.

We talk about the pitfalls of simply “going agile” with existing frameworks, how to keep the focus on strategic work (without forgetting keep-the-lights-on work), and how to reduce work efforts by at least 30%.</content>

        <content>Are you mad at your current stage-gate hardware process? Then let Dorian Simpson and Gary Hinkle introduce you to something that will make you feel good with MAHD – or Modified Agile for Hardware Development Framework.

Dorian and Gary will share how stage-gate, detailed process flows, and hierarchical organizational structures can slow the pace of innovation and rarely map to the reality of getting work done. Then, they will show you how to introduce an agile-first framework that puts customer value and teams first.</content>

        <content>As a researcher, Loreal Jiles has interviewed large and small organizations to learn the challenges and changes affecting finance. In doing that research, she discovered momentum to progress from data stewardship to value creation through deeper collaborations. Not surprisingly – especially given the pandemic – there is a significant shift to finance adapting to a fast pace of change.

With this change in mind, Loreal proposes that Finance organizations consider agility to react to change, scale for efficient operations, and empower multi-disciplinary teams.

In today’s podcast, Loreal shares examples of how agile can help finance teams streamline risk management, improve financial planning &amp; analysis functions, reduce the pain and increase the efficiency of internal audits, and much more.</content>

        <title>Getting in the agile zone with the fluency model</title>

        <content>Today, I speak with James Shore, author of The Art of Agile Development. We talk about the Agile Fluency Model he developed alongside Diana Larsen.

When you re-organize teams with a focus on agility, changes will not happen overnight. Teams will have to get used to new tools, processes, and interpersonal dynamics.

Bruce Tuckman created a model that recognizes specific team dynamics. The model proposes that teams go through several stages: forming, storming, norming, and performing. If you have ever been in a large team meeting to make critical business changes or are part of a re-org, you will be familiar with that model.

Re-structuring for agility means you will not only see the four phases of the Tuckman model but another as well. That is where James Shore and Diana Larsen come in. They designed a model to appreciate the cultural shift in how your teams gain fluency in delivering more value faster, and they call it the Agile Fluency Model.</content>

        <content>Business agility represents the continuous and purposeful change you make to deliver more value to your customers and gain a competitive edge. Very often, we use frameworks that guide how to be more agile.
The list of frameworks is endless and full of acronyms, like SCRUM, XP, SaFe, and many more. It can be tempting to select a framework that looks good and start using it. However, there are downsides to that approach.

In today’s podcast, I speak with Evan Leybourn, Co-founder and CEO of the Business Agility Institute. We talk about why agility can increase revenues, improve team performance, and retain employees. Evan shares the approach you should take to define what agility means to your organization and balance that with the various frameworks available to you.</content>

        <content>In today’s Agile in Action podcast, I speak with Jose Levy, Director of Cloud Services at OnePlan. We discuss the importance portfolio management processes and software still play in today’s modern organization.

In this podcast, he explains that as organizations embrace agile, leaders must recognize that not every project will use agile techniques. Further, not all teams will use the same applications to manage those projects. Different teams and functions in an organization can coexist on the agile spectrum while working towards a common objective.</content>

        <title>A day in the life of a SCRUM Master </title>
        <updated>2021-06-08T03:00:15-05:00</updated>

        <content>When you think about agile teams, or more specifically, Scrum teams, you will often hear about a role called the Scrum Master. That role is frequently confused, and you will often hear the position referred to as a project manager with a new and modern title.

For some, agile is a brand-new way to work, and therefore a brand new way of structuring your organization. Any organizational change requires new or changed roles, adjusting to a new culture, and shifting focus. That change is never-ending because customer needs, products, and technology will not stop changing our business landscape.

In today’s podcast, I speak with Michele Magnardini, Scrum Master at Sage. He talks about the role of a Scrum Master, which helps improve team dynamics and plays a critical role in continuous team improvements. If your organization is considering adopting agile, you likely came across the term Scrum. Agile and Scrum can represent a tectonic shift in how companies work and structure teams. Embracing this change is not a one-and-done project but an entirely new way of working, which means change will be continuous, with regular improvements in support of teams to deliver customer value.

In today’s fun and lively conversation Michele makes no assumptions that you are a Scrum expert, walking you through all the basics. You will learn how Scrum works, including the roles, meetings, and artifacts defined by the framework. Then, he shares the critical role of a Scrum Master.

Sadly, many consider the Scrum Master as a project manager with a new, modern title. That cannot be farther from the truth, and you will learn just how important the Scrum Master’s role is to that continuous improvement process I share earlier in this post.</content>
