        <content>Today, Chris Jones, partner at Silicon Valley Product Group and co-author of the book Empowered joins us to talk about the shift to agility and a product-focused culture.

Chris shares how too many times, we focus on delivering a project that we assume has a beginning, middle, and end when we should look at it differently. Successful organizations treat such efforts as a product where there is not necessarily a planned end in mind. There are full-time product teams that are hyper-focused on delivering customer-focused solutions to problems.</content>

        <content>Laura Pirro came to learn some agile concepts taking a course while at Ghent University. The course teacher said agile is primarily for software development and did not apply to R&amp;D. Laura decided to learn more about agile and found that R&amp;D projects could benefit from the ideas.

Without using the word “agile,” Laura started implementing some of the modern ideas brought to us by organizations like Scrum.org. Laura introduced regular, shorter meetings with the leads on projects (also called standup meetings). Laura also started developing smaller pieces of the overall R&amp;D work with her colleagues by writing smaller, manageable elements of the comprehensive paper and then iterating on that (also called MVPs, or minimum viable products).

Now working for Yara International, Laura shares insights and real-world examples that may inspire you as a student or working in the private sector.</content>

        <content>Agile teams often think differently than more traditional project planning efforts. Gone are months-long project schedules with tasks, milestones, and resource plans. In place of that are autonomous teams that define a value-driven backlog of work, and they schedule that work in short iterations (or sprints) over 1-4 weeks.

Those teams will estimate the work and determine what can be done based on value and capacity for the upcoming iteration. Rather than detail the hours the teams work, they plan with story points.

But what exactly are story points, and how do they support planning efforts? That is what Mike Cohn shares in today’s podcast.</content>

        <content>In today’s lively conversation with Adam Jennison, Enterprise Agile Consultant, you will learn how agile teams estimate their work and track how well they performed based on the estimate. You will also learn how to implement these concepts in your team, no matter what type of work you do.

If you come from a traditional project management background, you are likely familiar with the process of defining tasks, assigning resources, and estimating hours.

As organizations continue their shift to product-centric work, agile teams will define what they can accomplish in short iterations (or sprints). Those iterations typically run 1-4 weeks. An agile team will look at the backlog of work and determine what they will do based on criteria like value, risk, and hours to complete. Rather than estimating individual hours for each person, the team will agree to story points. When the iteration is complete, you can use a velocity metric to determine how well they did against the plan.

If you are unfamiliar with story points and velocity, do not fret. Adam explains it all with ease and shares some great stories along the way.</content>

        <content>Veteran guest on the Agile in Action Podcast, James Shore returns to announce the general availability of his new book, The Art of Agile Development, the Second Edition. James shares what you will learn and how development teams can benefit from the book, including walking through the Fluency Model. In the text below, you will find the book’s description, including a link to get a copy for yourself.

Most companies developing software employ something they call “Agile.” But there’s widespread misunderstanding of what Agile is and how to use it. If you want to improve your software development team’s agility, this comprehensive guidebook’s clear, concrete, and detailed guidance explains what to do and why, and when to make trade-offs.

In this thorough update of the classic Agile how-to guide, James Shore provides no-nonsense advice on Agile adoption, planning, development, delivery, and management taken from over two decades of Agile experience. He brings the latest ideas from Extreme Programming, Scrum, Lean, DevOps, and more into a cohesive whole. Learn how to successfully bring Agile development to your team and organization–or discover why Agile might not be for you.

This book explains how to:


  Improve agility: create the conditions necessary for Agile to succeed and scale in your organization
  Focus on value: work as a team, understand priorities, provide visibility, and improve continuously
  Deliver software reliably: share ownership, decrease development costs, evolve designs, and deploy continuously
  Optimize value: take ownership of product plans, budgets, and experiments–and produce market-leading software</content>

        <content>Organizations that want to be more agile will often create small, autonomous teams that can deliver faster. The structure for those teams often looks similar to those defined by SCRUM. However, what happens when many SCRUM teams, maybe 20, 30, or more, need to work on coordinated release efforts? That is a problem the Scaled Agile Framework (or SAFe) may need to answer.

In today’s podcast, I speak with Sander Dur, Agile Coach, SCRUM Trainer, Licensed SAFe Trainer, and the Podcast host at “Mastering Agility”. Sander will walk you through a lightweight conversation of what SAFe is, introducing some of the differences between SAFe and SCRUM, and then we talk about what it means to move toward agility.</content>

        <content>Have you ever opened up an app that you love, just to be bothered by that one critical feature that hardly works, feels too slow, or is just frustrating to use? Chances are, the developers that wrote that code are all too aware of the problem. Maybe the code is too complex to fix without re-writing it, or perhaps their priorities shift to some other newer and shinier feature of the product. We call problems like this technical debt, and it is a growing problem that we must address.

In today’s podcast, I speak with Alex Omeyer, Co-founder and CEO of Stepsize. Alex walks us through the various types of technical debt teams can accumulate. We then talk about how technical debt can impact teams, morale, and the customer’s end product.

Alex proposes solutions to drive down technical debt by incorporating it directly into the development lifecycle. His organization, Stepsize, makes it easier to track technical debt and provide traceability, so the process ties directly into the standard tools developers use daily.</content>

        <content>Product Lifecycle Management, especially for large and complex products like automobiles, is ripe for re-invention. Organizations adopt agile techniques and focus on smaller, more focused teams to deliver more competitive and customer-centric solutions at near breakneck speeds.

Imagine building a car, for example. Tracking all the parts from vendors around the world would be hard enough. Now, imagine all the silicon and software in a modern car to manage everything from acceleration and breaking to climate controls and music. All that hardware and software have must work in unison, and you need to track all the parts and dependencies in a centralized database.

Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending on how you look at it), there is rarely no centralized database. Most organizations have multiple software products to manage parts, vendors, and software. That is where the Openness certification comes in, and Michael Hertwig is sharing how it works.</content>

        <content>In our latest “Agile for…” series, we talk to Andrea Fryrear about Agile for Marketing. We discuss the unique structure of a marketing organization and the opportunities to reduce complexity and introduce agile methods.

We talk about the pitfalls of simply “going agile” with existing frameworks, how to keep the focus on strategic work (without forgetting keep-the-lights-on work), and how to reduce work efforts by at least 30%.</content>

Dorian and Gary will share how stage-gate, detailed process flows, and hierarchical organizational structures can slow the pace of innovation and rarely map to the reality of getting work done. Then, they will show you how to introduce an agile-first framework that puts customer value and teams first.</content>

        <content>As a researcher, Loreal Jiles has interviewed large and small organizations to learn the challenges and changes affecting finance. In doing that research, she discovered momentum to progress from data stewardship to value creation through deeper collaborations. Not surprisingly – especially given the pandemic – there is a significant shift to finance adapting to a fast pace of change.

With this change in mind, Loreal proposes that Finance organizations consider agility to react to change, scale for efficient operations, and empower multi-disciplinary teams.

In today’s podcast, Loreal shares examples of how agile can help finance teams streamline risk management, improve financial planning &amp; analysis functions, reduce the pain and increase the efficiency of internal audits, and much more.</content>

        <content>Today, I speak with James Shore, author of The Art of Agile Development. We talk about the Agile Fluency Model he developed alongside Diana Larsen.

When you re-organize teams with a focus on agility, changes will not happen overnight. Teams will have to get used to new tools, processes, and interpersonal dynamics.

Bruce Tuckman created a model that recognizes specific team dynamics. The model proposes that teams go through several stages: forming, storming, norming, and performing. If you have ever been in a large team meeting to make critical business changes or are part of a re-org, you will be familiar with that model.

Re-structuring for agility means you will not only see the four phases of the Tuckman model but another as well. That is where James Shore and Diana Larsen come in. They designed a model to appreciate the cultural shift in how your teams gain fluency in delivering more value faster, and they call it the Agile Fluency Model.</content>
