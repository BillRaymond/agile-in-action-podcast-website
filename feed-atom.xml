Transcript

(transcripts are auto-generated, so please excuse the brevity)
Reama Dagasan: I learn really well from parables like Aesop’s Fables or the Greek myths. A lot of those are parables and they’re there to teach you lessons. And I feel like when we get somebody that is applying Agile and talking about it, I’m not sure if it’s exactly a parable, but it feels that way to me.

Bill Raymond: Hi and welcome to the podcast. Today, I’m joined by a very special guest. It’s Reama Dagasan, CEO of PastaBiz, an EMILIOMITI company, and also the executive producer of the Agile in Action Podcast.

Bill Raymond: Hi, Reama, how are you today?

Reama Dagasan: I’m good, Bill. How are you?

Today’s Topics

Bill Raymond: I’m doing great. I’m excited because you’re going to be sharing with us some of the things that you’ve learned about Agile in your personal career. And we’re also going to have a little two-year anniversary retrospective of the Agile in Action Podcast.

About Reama

Bill Raymond: Before we get started, can you just talk a little bit about your background?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, I am a high school dropout who later went on to get her Bachelor of Science in International Studies and later, a Master’s in Business Administration. And I have spent the last 16 years of my career helping small companies get bigger. And I have been with PastaBiz for, gosh, 13 years now. And I have taken some sabbaticals and done other things. I’ve had a couple of interesting side-gigs through my career, but my one constant has been helping companies to grow.

Reama’s Work at PastaBiz

Bill Raymond: Can you talk a little bit about what you do at PastaBiz?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah. So my current title is CEO, and I really just think of myself as the General Manager, but I absolutely wear a lot of hats there at the company. I help with everything from operational things, such as purchasing, procurement, forecasting, getting machines onto the boats, handling finance, HR, accounting. There’s really no aspect of that business that I haven’t been involved with in some way, short of packaging crates to leave our company or repairing machines. I leave those to people that are better qualified than myself.

Bill Raymond: And when we talk about machines, when we say PastaBiz, we really mean pasta as in Italian pasta, right?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, exactly. So people think that we make pasta, but the reality is, if you’ve eaten at a restaurant that has a pasta machine, there’s a really good chance that we’ve sold them that machine. Or if you have purchased fresh, locally-produced pasta at Whole Foods or Sprouts or another similar market, there’s a good chance that’s made on a machine that we’ve brought here to the States.

Reama Dagasan: All of our products come from Italy, with the exception of two specialty items that we source from elsewhere, but there’s a very, very strong Italian connection.

About Pastabiz

Bill Raymond: What are some of the types of equipment that you sell frequently?

our most popular items are extruders, and those are a lot like the Play-Doh sets we had as children. And you fill the thing with Play-Doh and you put on a disc and you push it and out comes a star or a square piece of Play-Doh. That’s one of our most common things, but we also have machines that will make fresh pasta sheets that you can cut into Tagliatelle or Pappardelle, but also Ravioli and Cappelletti machines.

Reama Dagasan: So it’s really, it’s pretty neat. What I really like about the job is, it’s a great product and you’re helping people to produce really beautiful food.

Bill Raymond: There is nothing like fresh pasta.

I’m a fan. I actually finally broke down and bought my first extruder a few months ago, and it has been way too fun to play with.

Agile Techniques Reama likes to use

Bill Raymond: Since you’ve been the executive producer of the Agile in Action Podcast, you’ve had some takeaways. I think It would be cool to hear what you might be using Agile techniques for in your business.

Reama Dagasan: We’re based in San Francisco. I was living in San Francisco and our town was one of the first that decided to lock down in March 16th, 2020. Now, as a company that supports food production, we’re absolutely an essential business, but we then had to quickly pivot, which is a really heavily-used word, but we all had to.

Reama Dagasan: And I sent as many of our people who could work remotely home as possible in order to allow for distancing, et cetera. So we really struggled with that initially, because it’s a very different way of working when you lose those in-person interactions. We had a guest, Sarah Shewell, and she referred to them as I think, “water cooler moments” where you have those brief exchanges of ideas that just come about organically. And so that was definitely a big change for us.

Reama Dagasan: As I have produced this podcast, it’s actually been really helpful to me in my day to day role in that company. It’s Helped me learn better ways to create team cohesion. It’s taught me or refreshed my memory about avoiding communication silos, which was something that I learned in business school back in I want to say 2006, 2007, 2008 were the years that I attended while working. And Agile reminded me of this, you know, how important it is to have clear communication with the people you’re working with. And we’re a small company, so there shouldn’t be silos. But we all have to work together, and I think that’s one of my big takeaways from Agile, and that’s a very high-level perspective, but it’s been a nice, consistent reminder that I’ve heard from our guests each week.

Bill Raymond: That’s a big focus of our podcast, that kind of stands us out a little bit. And I know that you play a big part in that, in that we don’t just have a bunch of people talking about how to do software development. We do, but we also talk about how you can run your business more efficiently. We talk about how teams can work together and collaborate together in a better way. And you’ve really been a key element in making sure that happens.

Reama’s perspective on agile

Bill Raymond: So I think from working on this podcast for a while, you have maybe developed your own personal perspective on Agile. And I’m curious what your takeaway is from that term.

Yes, that I feel well equipped to address. So, no,I’m not an Agilist or an Agile practitioner, but for me, the things that I’ve learned from this podcast, from producing and listening, are applicable to anybody that’s running a business.

**Reama Dagasan:__ **And so I feel like the podcast is a lot more than just about Agile. It’s about how to successfully navigate an ever-changing business landscape. **

Reama Dagasan: For example, it’s taught me to ** **communicate better. It’s taught me to hopefully be a better leader with a clear direction, you know, because that’s one of the most important things that I think I’ve learned from this podcast, is that clear sense of like, well, we are here now and where do we want to be?

Reama Dagasan: Agile helps to bring you to that where you want to be.

Reama Dagasan: Like, in our instance, we started with, we want to have a podcast and now it’s, you know, maybe our future goal is we want to have a podcast with 100,000 listeners. So we can use Agile, even in the context of producing a podcast, to help us get there. On a daily level, I think that one of my fun takeaways from Agile has been keeping meetings short. I am now the world’s biggest proponent of a standup. And it’s really interesting because in 2019, before I had started working with you on this podcast, I did a 10-minute meeting every morning with the team to talk about, what is on your plate today? What do you have scheduled? What support do you need from the other people that are here?

Reama Dagasan: And it was the coolest thing when I realized this thing that I had just started was actually, it had a name, it was a standup in Agile. And it was amusing because we would stand up during these meetings to really connote that it wasn’t meant to be a long, long discussion. But it was a chance for us to work, to support each other in our tasks that we had that day.

Bill Raymond: That’s really cool that you had adopted that, and then you were able to connect a name to it after.

Reama Dagasan: Yeah. It’s, you know, this is a real thing. This wasn’t just something that, you know, Reama pulled out of thin air. It’s a very efficient way to cover communication with your team, and a very efficient way to make sure that you guys are aligning what you’re trying to do. And that was the whole purpose, that meeting was to align what we were all working on together that day to make sure that we were supporting and being effective and able to leave, you know, at five o’clock, because we had worked in an efficient andcoherent fashion together.

Bill Raymond: That alignment piece is actually really important that’s the one thing that I always feel very strongly that you do best. You always manage to take a bunch of words that, I mean, someone like me might say,and if it’s not clear, you drill down and you drill down and you do it in a very nice and personable way.

Bill Raymond: You don’t feel like you’re being grilled. And then all of a sudden, we’re in agreement as to what needs to be done, and I’ve always appreciated your ability to do that.

A softer approach to asking questions

Reama Dagasan: Thank you for saying that. I don’t like being put in the hot seat with questions, and sometimes our first answer is not our best answer. And those are things that I try to remember. As much as Agile is focused on doing things in a quick way, by following these iterative processes so that you don’t go all the way back to the drawing board at the beginning, at the same time that speed is important, I’ve also learned that sometimes giving somebody the day to get back to you, ** **or maybe a couple of days, if it’s really important, is actually going to be better because you’re going to have the right information.

Reama Dagasan: You want to make sure that you give whoever you’re working with time to get the right answer that’s the right version, and not rely on their memory when they’re feeling very pressured.

Reama Dagasan: And that’s why I’ve adopted more of ** **a softer approach when asking questions, having a disagreement or trying to get information out of somebody. Fear has no place in the workplace. And so if somebody isterrified because of how I’ve delivered a question or a statement, that becomes a barrier to communication.

Bill Raymond: I really appreciate that thought process that you go through. And it’s hard too, because sometimes when you’re leading an organization, of course you want your fingers on the tip of everything and you always want to know what’s going on. So it’s important to be able to create that space for people to continue to innovate and do what they need to without putting so much pressure on them.

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, or you know, you can make a mistake and it will not be forever held over your head or it won’t be weaponized, because that I feel would crush people’s sense of ownership over work or crush their willingness to think in a new way. And that’s not what we want? It’s like, yes, we sell machines, we work with artists, and we need to be creative to support them.

The Agile in Action Podcast

Bill Raymond: Let’s talk a little bit about Agile in Action, the podcast. I don’t think we talked about this before we started the podcast. It’s got to have been at least five years that we’ve been working together now, right?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, I want to say it was 2017. I was on somewhat of a sabbatical. I was working part-time at PastaBiz. I just needed a little bit of time to kind of slow life down. And yeah, so I started working with you in 2017. And for those that don’t know, I was originally helping Bill with his accounting, because it’s, one of the many hats that I wear. And so that’s how I came to know Bill.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, and I think that’s putting it lightly. I’ve always looked at you as a business partner, because you didn’t just I’m doing air quotes on the screen right now, you can’t see them, but you never just did the books. You were always making sure that this company was successful and you put in that extra work that I actually didn’t have an expectation of, but I’ve always come to appreciate it and still do to this day.

Reama Dagasan: Well, you’re welcome. And that’s one thing I think that’s been true in my career, is I’ve had people who, the company is so new, not necessarily in your case, but I’ve really been able to come in and define what my own position is, and really like take ownership. And that’s been a constant for me and it’s been something I’m really grateful for.

Reama Dagasan: I’ve never really worked at a corporate job and maybe I would have those opportunities there, but the small companies that I’ve worked for have always let me sort of blaze my own trail and create my own systems and structures to help them, and been really receptive and happy about it. So I’m super lucky in that way.

Bill Raymond: We formally worked together as partners on the Agile in Action Podcast for two years. This is actually our two-year anniversary this month. And we have published, I think we’re up to something along the lines of 72 podcasts now. We started off bi-weekly, and now we are at a weekly cadence, just taking breaks for holidays and periods of time when we know people are traveling with family and things like that. But we’ve been going weekly and I just, it’s amazing the breadth of guests that we’ve had.

Reama’s role on the podcast

Bill Raymond: But before I get into that, could you talk a little bit about your role that you’ve played as the executive producer here at the podcast?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah. My first task really was to help find interesting people that could share their knowledge, that would be willing to do this with us. And it started with some keywords in Agile, like, product lifecycle management or SCRUM but it started with a list of keywords and me looking at people and finding articles and people that were, speaking and sharing ideas or authors of books. And over time, my knowledge of Agile has deepened and we’ve gotten at sometimes, a little deeper in the weeds with people that we have on the show. One of my very favorite things to do is like, Hey Bill, this person’s talking about Agile and supply chain management, can we have them on, can we have them on? And you’re thinking, I’m not really super sure about supply chain management, that’s not my field. It is part of my field day to day, but you’ve always been game to go with it and be like, let’s talk to them and see how they’re using Agile in this new and exciting way.

Reama Dagasan: How are people using Agile for information management, for example? So my role is like finding these interesting people with great ideas so that we could share it with the broader world. I had initially anticipated that it would be really tech-heavy, and I’ve been grateful that we’ve brought it out to things that are not directly related to technology, such as the supply chain management, and that’s let me feel like I’ve got to make my own sort of path here in some ways.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, we’ve gotten into it with human resources, marketing, sales, any number of different areas of expertise. And one of the things that I appreciate about what you’ve done with the podcast is, you do put me out of my comfort zone, and I like it. At first, I was a little worried because I thought there were some topics that I was saying, I don’t know how this connects with Agile, or I’m worried that people are going to use words I don’t understand. But it turns out, when you’re just having a conversational podcast like this, it’s pretty straightforward, and people recognize that they have an audience that may not know their business.

Bill Raymond: And it’s pretty rare that we get someone that starts throwing a bunch of acronyms out without explaining them first. And it makes it easy for all of us to have a good conversation, and it expands our minds as to what Agile can do for people outside of that pure software development world.

Reama Dagasan: Absolutely, and I think that is something that I would like to let our listeners know is that, you know, yes, the title is Agile in Action, but I firmly believe that a lot of the topics that we discuss are applicable to any company. There’s lessons that I’ve learned on the podcast that I take with me and we are in no way, shape or form an Agile organization, but the tips, the ideas, the concepts, the information have a thousand percent been transferable over to my day to day life at work.

The podcast editing process

Bill Raymond: Yeah, absolutely, and I feel the same way, to be honest with you. It is interesting because we do have this editing process where we have to sit down and listen to the podcast, and then we just find things like, we do the initial thing, right? Which is listen for dogs barking, babies crying in the background, because everyone’s doing this from home, and then we have to kind of clean up some of the general conversation that doesn’t, you know, work inside the podcast. And there’s a lot of editing there, and I know you spend a lot of time going through that.

Bill Raymond: But one of the things that I’ve always appreciated was the end product, when it’s finally done and you’ve sent it through, to the sound people, and you’ve sent it through all of this editing and we’ve kind of gone back and forth and collaborated on that. When it’s done, I sit down and listen to the podcast. Usually, I listen to it with one pod in my right ear, on a bike ride while I’m in the park and I put it on, and then I learn something. I don’t always learn something in the moment because you know, there’s this sort of drive to keep the conversation going.

Bill Raymond: And it’s amazing how much after having listened to each podcast, four or five times before it goes public, where then I can sit down and say, Wow, look, there’s actually some really good content here.

Absolutely. When I’m editing podcasts, I don’t learn anything, because I’m more focused on, where is the strange sound? But once I’m done with that process and we would get it back from the sound engineer, then I could listen to the whole thing. And then I could take that 30,000 foot view that our listeners are also able to take. And that’s when it all kind of sinks in. Because I had been fretting over words and pauses and little things, but then you get to listen and see the whole thing, you get to step back and see why, this is a great podcast and a great lesson that was not as clear when I was worried about phrasing and ums and uhs.

Finding podcast guests

Bill Raymond: I’m curious, you’ve spent a lot of time helping to find the guests and, I love the range of topics that we have. How do you look at finding guests to make sure that it’s a well-rounded podcast?

Reama Dagasan: I always like to find people doing Agile a little bit different. One of the things that I’ve tried to find, are people that are using Agile in non-software development ways. I like to find people that are practitioners. I’m always very grateful when we can find somebody that is there where the rubber meets the road and is practicing Agile day to day, and can provide us with concrete concepts and concrete application of this idea of Agile. Because I believe that applied Agile is a great way to present this information.

Reama Dagasan: I learn really well from parables like Aesop’s Fables or the Greek myths. A lot of those are parables and they’re there to teach you lessons. And I feel like when we get somebody that is applying Agile and talking about it, I’m not sure if it’s exactly a parable, but it feels that way to me. And it’s easy for me to take that in and I hope that for our listeners, when they can hear how people are using Agile day to day, they understand the appeal of it, but they also feel more empowered to apply it to their day to day. Maybe the whole org doesn’t undergo a transformation, but maybe they change one little aspect of their career and at their workplace, and it’s beneficial.

Bill Raymond: We also have a pretty diverse guest list anyone from a practitioner to someone using it in their own personal work life, executives and team members. And it’s great to have all of their perspectives.

Guests that stood out for Reama

Bill Raymond: Are there any particular guests that really stood out for you?

Reama Dagasan: Yes. I would say that one of my very favorites, because her words resonated so strongly with me was Sarah Shewell and her discussions about supporting people as you go remote and creating those opportunities for people to speak, for them not to be silenced in Zoom meetings, and actively soliciting feedback from people who might otherwise be quiet during a meeting, was really profound.

Reama Dagasan: And as I now work remote from my team three weeks out of the month, her lessons are something that I use day to day, to work effectively with the people that I work with.

That’s really cool. Of course, I think I told you this when we were first starting the podcast, my dream was to have two people on that got me started and interested in this. And that was Mary and Tom Poppendieck who are the authors of Lean Software Development.

Bill Raymond: Of course, I come from a technology background and I am a consultant, helping organizations run projects, and I also help organizations do Agile transformation. And one of the things that helped me clarify, especially when I was working on a really large technical project was this book, Lean Software Development. And I was so excited when you were able to get them onto the podcast. And so I,still to this day, appreciate your work to do that.

A diverse guest list

Reama Dagasan: My pleasure, you know, I am very excited about our guest list, and so it’s been very exciting to have a lot of women that are in technology on the show, to show that we are all out here and we’re all running our companies successfully and playing really valuable roles, and either doing Agile, sort of by the book and you know, having sprints and retrospectives and following this framework really firmly and religiously, or just kind of touching on Agile, but using it to make things better.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, absolutely. I think if you just scroll through the AgileinAction.com podcast, you could see, we have a very diverse list of guests. And I absolutely adore that we have that. And I do give the praise to you for having made sure that that happens.

Reama Dagasan: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I mean, the world is, we’re at what, 7 billion people, and we’re all very different, but we all have a lot that we can add. And so it’s just up to us to go find those voices that have a fresh and exciting new message to share with us and with our listeners.

Bill Raymond: Absolutely. Reama, I’m so glad that you were able to take the time to share your own personal experience and how you use Agile in your own life.

Bill Raymond: Plus also, celebrate this two-year anniversary in this special edition of the podcast. I really appreciate your time today.

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, thank you for having me on and thank you for letting me be a part of this podcast. It’s been interesting both to learn some new technical tricks, you know, I can now produce a podcast, but it’s also been a very exciting way to learn something new each week.

Bill Raymond: If anyone wants to reach out to you, how might they do that?

Reama Dagasan: So you are welcome to reach me via the contact link on the website. It’s reama.dagasan@cambermast.com. You can connect with me on LinkedIn. And those are really the best ways to reach me. I have a low social media profile, so those are the routes I would suggest.

Bill Raymond: I will make sure that your LinkedIn profile link is on the AgileinAction.com podcast website.

Bill Raymond: And also of course, if you’re in a app right now and you want to reach out to Reama, just go ahead and go to the show notes or the description, and you’ll see that LinkedIn link there as well. Thank you for your time today, Reama.

Reama Dagasan: Thank you, Bill and listeners, I hope that we’ll be hearing from you. We’d love to speak with you. Cheers.</content>

About today’s podcast

Bill Raymond: Hi, this is bill Raymond. I used to lead the software development team in an IT department at a global manufacturing company. This company was well known for providing high quality products to other companies with very high standards.

Bill Raymond: Our previous CFO retired and the new one came on board. This new CFO started asking for things you would probably expect such as master procurement plans, plant efficiency reports, and much more. Unfortunately, the results were frankly a bit of a mess.

Bill Raymond: Each manufacturing plant had a General Manager managing nearly everything, including their own procurement systems, IT staff, and had their own financial teams.

Bill Raymond: When the CFO asked me and my colleagues to visit the corporate office, he had a very straightforward question, which was why the heck – well, he didn’t say heck, so feel free to select from your library of expletives and choice, colorful words, and you will understand the tension in the room – but the message was this: why the heck don’t we as a publicly traded company that has to report financials to the street, have to rely on 300 people with paper, pencils, and adding machines to get the numbers that should be updated daily in front of the CFO on his computer screen?

Bill Raymond: Of course you could go in with a bunch of “that’s how we always did it” excuses, or you could bring solutions. We proposed some groundbreaking stuff and I think at this point, you’ll probably notice that I’m being a little sarcastic, but we proposed a centralized corporate IT division that would standardize our email and network infrastructure, and most importantly, build a centralized financial system.

Bill Raymond: The CFO agreed to this and working with the CEO and his colleagues formalized that corporate CIO role. However, he did not want to wait for us to get started. We immediately began hiring third-party vendors to help us bridge technology gaps while we worked on the more challenging part of implementing a full scale global financial system.

Bill Raymond: Unfortunately, some of those contractors were better than others and of course, some did a great job. But there were others that had important roles where they could not get the software written in a timely manner, they did not understand the scope, and we generally had poor communications with them.

Bill Raymond: As part of that learning, we let a number of companies go. We sat back and created a model for how we would work with outside software development firms. Instead of looking for the fastest people to turn the work around, we looked for more experience. Instead of hiring the most well-known firms, we found the ones that would offer our teams the best cultural fit. With these and other criteria in place, we found some great companies and fairly quickly I noticed we stopped calling them contractors and started calling them business partners.

Bill Raymond: Later I worked with one of those partners and I had the unique opportunity to learn what it was like on the other side. I quickly learned that it is not necessarily the surface you provide, but how you build and maintain trust with your customer. I also learned that as a service provider you often have standards and practices for how you work.

Bill Raymond: However, the customer may have a vastly different way of doing things. We see this in software today where software developers adopt agile practices and methods to deliver their software. But maybe the customer does not. Even small things like terminology and communication styles can be vastly different.

Bill Raymond: Many of you as regular Agile in Action podcast listeners tell me that working with outside service providers can be, shall we say, trickier than you might’ve thought. That is why I asked Dr. Mark Balbes to be a guest on today’s podcast. We’ll get into Mark’s role in just a moment but what I hope you get out of today’s podcast are some practical ways to bridge the gap and build highly effective teams when working with third party service providers.

Bill Raymond: Of course, if you are a service provider, Mark provides invaluable insight into how you can build the best possible relationship with your customers.

Bill Raymond: So with that, let’s get started!

Introductions

Bill Raymond: Hi and welcome to the podcast. Today I’m joined by Mark Balbes senior director of modern software enablement in application services at Worldwide Technology.

Bill Raymond: Hi Mark, how are you today?

Mark Balbes: I’m great. Thanks for asking how are you?

Bill Raymond: I’m doing great. Thank you. We’re going to be talking about quality agile delivery with external stakeholders, but before we get into all of that could you introduce yourself?

Mark Balbes: Yeah. You already stole my name and my title and everything. Balbes Senior Director at Worldwide Technology. So my background, I am a high school dropout. I’m a PhD nuclear physicist. I am a trained salt miner, software developer for many years, and uh, now I have the joy of leading multiple teams at Worldwide Technology across different services related to software development including our agile transformation practice and our software modernization practice.

Bill Raymond: Wonderful. Let’s get into that a little bit. Could you explain what Worldwide Technology is for anyone that doesn’t know them?

Mark Balbes: Yeah we’re a unknown gem for folks that don’t know us. Started out really in the computer networking equipment resell business, where the largest Cisco reseller. So if you’re in, in the business, people know about us, we’re also solution providers. So we have different capabilities around helping folks with digital transformation, with agile transformation, which is part of what I’m doing uh, software development.

Mark Balbes: So all services related to the IT industry. We can, we can help you buy the hardware, install the hardware, configure it, write the software for it, help you find people. So really a lot of different services. It’s really fun to be here, because there’s so much going on.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I absolutely love working with a company that has a diverse set of clients and different types of work that you can do. There’s nothing better than being able to just wake up and see what’s new the next day.

Mark Balbes: It’s fantastic because you’re right. It’s a lot of it is what toys do I get to play with today?

Challenges of working with exterrnal business partners

Bill Raymond: And from that perspective, we’re gonna be talking a little bit about quality agile delivery, but we’re gonna do this in a little bit of a different way. Normally, when we talk about this, we’re talking about how you do it within your organization. And you’re going to talk about that, but there’s another layer of this that I think, as a company that does consulting business and having worked with many in the past.

Bill Raymond: One of the challenges that we’ve always had with agile is we create these great i nternal processes, but then we have these clients, these pesky clients that have their own yeah, that have their own way of doing things and it might still be agile, but it may not be the way we defined it either. So it’s gonna be interesting to talk to you about the differences between the two. But before we get into the external part, let’s talk about the internal part. You said you’re part of an agile transformation effort and you have mentioned that you’ve adopted agile. Can you talk a little bit about that journey and what you have adopted so far the types of things that you’ve done within your own organization at Worldwide Technology?

Mark Balbes: Yeah, absolutely. I’ve been with the organization for about 15 years. So I’ve gotten to see a lot of change going on and that’s one of the interesting things is to look back at how we developed software 15 years ago on the cutting edge of agile. Where we are today and what’s changed and what’s still the same, which is just as important.

Mark Balbes: So like you said, we’re a large part of our business is building applications either for our customers or with our customers. We have our own internal teams that we run in a extremely agile fashion. And I can describe that. But then we also have models of engagement with our customers where we’re co-developing with them, or we’re helping to enable them to develop so helping to teach them better practices around software development, like being more agile or moving to the cloud or any of number of things that we can do to help them.

Mark Balbes: So with, within our own teams we really have embraced strongly the agile manifesto and the principles and originally for probably the first 10 years or so. That was really our guiding light was the agile manifesto that we would go back to. And what we realized was in working for so long with our different customers, different kinds of customers. And I know we’ll get into to the wide variety that we have just within application services. We wanted our own delivery principles, cribbing a lot from the agile manifesto, but focused on what we do. So the manifesto is really meant, it’s very general for software development. You could be applied to a product company, a services company anyone developing software, including us.

Mark Balbes: And we develop software for other people. We don’t have our own products for the most part, we have a couple. But most of what we do is building stuff for our customers. That’s a very specific kind of way of working and we wanted to be more tailored to that. And so we came up with our delivery principles and we have 10 of them. I can rattle them off if you’d like me to and say what they are.

Worldwide Technology’s Agile principles

Bill Raymond: Yeah. Could you share what the principles are that you’ve developed internally?

Mark Balbes: Absolutely.

Mark Balbes: The first one is customer value that our highest priority is to provide value to the customer in alignment with their expectations. So that alignment piece is different from the agile manifesto. It’s not about what we want. It’s about what our customer wants and making sure we’re working together toward that.

Mark Balbes: Embrace change. We embrace changing requirements even late in delivery. So that’s pretty much the same.

Mark Balbes: Deploy often release working software as frequently as the client can tolerate. So that’s different, right? It’s not released as frequently as possible. It’s as frequently as the client can tolerate, we have a customer, the Department of Defense and we build for them what we call the Mobile Field Kit.

Mark Balbes: And you can go out and find videos on the MFK. Every time we do a release of the Mobile Field Kit, it costs them millions and millions of dollars because it’s not just accepting the release. They have to go out and train all of their people on it, which means doing actual exercises with it, going out into the field, deploying and making sure they understand how the new features impact their mission.

Mark Balbes: Testing first of all, does it work the way it’s supposed to, but more importantly, does it improve their operational capability? And releasing more than twice a year, big official releases is really expensive for them. So we release often internally, but they can’t tolerate big releases frequently. So that’s a difference, right? How frequently they can tolerate it, not how frequently can we do it?

Bill Raymond: Yeah. And that’s an interesting one because I’m thinking about an agile team, especially in software development, you’ll see it normally be somewhere between one and three weeks where something gets released and it’s, and we call those sprints usually or iterations. And what you’re saying is you might still work in that fashion, but the customer may not see the, all the effort around that work for some period of time.

Mark Balbes: That’s right. We will still release internally. We still do regular demos every week or every couple of weeks with our customer so they can see our progress. We do everything as frequently as possible up to the point of release at least with the Mobile Field Kit. And of course it depends on the customers and how we’re interacting with them, how far we can go before we have to match their schedule instead of our schedule.

Bill Raymond: Sorry, I interrupted you there. You were on number three, which is deploy as often as a client can tolerate.

Mark Balbes: Yep. Work together. So customers and the delivery team must work together regularly throughout the project delivery.

Mark Balbes: Next one is communicate effectively. So we intentionally choose the most effective ways to communicate with our teams and stakeholders. Different customers respond to communication in different ways, more than just do we email you or do we, text you or something like that, but there’s different formats for how we do status reporting. One of my projects that I’m working with the team now. We pretty much revamped how we do our status meeting with our customer to more closely align to what they want out of that status report versus our standard out of the box status report that we do.

Mark Balbes: Ours is pretty cool. We had our UX team go through it and we did all kinds of usability studies to make sure that, our standard report status reporting was as good as possible and our customers could understand it. You do all that work and you show it to the customer and they’re gonna tell you they want something different and it’s not for us to say, but we did all this work! It’s yeah, okay let’s figure out what’s effective for you.

Mark Balbes: Sustainable pace. So the delivery team’s processes should enable them to maintain a sustainable pace throughout the project delivery cycle .

Mark Balbes: Design or sustainment continuous attention to good design maintainability and sustainment enhances agility and aids, ongoing support.

Mark Balbes: So sustainment is, I think with my experience with agile, it’s one of those things that you have to be really careful about. That you’re thinking about it. We’ve had challenges in the past before we started really paying attention to it that, agile teams can work fast and they can get stuff out the door and it’s really cool. But did anyone think about how do you maintain the system? How do you sustain it going forward for us, how is our customer going to take over that running application and actually keep it running and add to it and keep it a living thing. So we pay very close attention to that.

Mark Balbes: Simplicity. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential. I think that’s word for word from the agile manifesto. It’s so important.

Mark Balbes: Measure and improve continuous measurement and improvement is vital at the individual and team levels. We do a lot with our people around their own professional development and helping them qualitatively and quantitatively know where they’re at with their capabilities, with their careers. We spend a lot of time doing that.

Mark Balbes: So agile tends to be about the team. How fast is the team going? How productive are they? How can we go faster? We do all of that too. That is essential, right? When you’re on a project, you are optimizing the team, not the individual, but there’s still the need from a company perspective to know how your individuals are performing. So we try to not have that be anecdotal. We like it to be a little bit more concrete that gives that person more feedback for them about where they can improve or where they’re doing well. That’s just as important and, lean into the things they’re doing well and get even better and help with the things where they need.

Mark Balbes: And then healthy teamwork, the best outcomes are produced through healthy teamwork. We absolutely believe in that. It is very rare that we have a single person working on something that is, a larger kind of engagement. We’ll always try to get at least a pair of people on it, if not a full team. So those are them.

Bill Raymond: Thank you very much. And that last one was so important. I used to run a software development team at another consulting firm. One of the things that I was always trying to do was just have sort of a developer on a project because we kind of got stretched a little thin usually, and one of the biggest challenges that we had with that, which is interesting was that the team member that was doing the work, were always struggling to find someone that can do the, that can QA the work. And they’re trying to find people they can bounce ideas off of, but there’s, they’re not there on the project. And I was worried about increasing the team to have this sort of multiple people on a client team, because that means more money to the customer.

Bill Raymond: But what I saw was the quality went up very significantly when we staffed a little bit more for the team and sometimes the customer would come back and say Bill, how come your estimate is much higher than these other estimates? And I’ve found that actually not only was it a selling point, but it was a fact that they were going to get a higher quality product when we have that healthy teamwork those teams that can work together just because someone else is paying for the work the people on the other ends that have to do the work, they need to be part of something where they can work with other people and feel comfortable that they’re doing their best.

Mark Balbes: That’s absolutely true. The other thing you have to think about is the total cost of ownership, that when you have that lower quality product, you are gonna be fixing bugs. You are gonna have a harder time maintaining it over time. And so I I’m maybe a little bit nasty when customers ask can we not do pair programming?

Mark Balbes: Can we not do a utomated testing and my response to things like that is, is, yeah we can add some time to not do those things because that’s what happens when you pair program the, they go faster, the quality goes up, which means you get more features in the same amount of time. My observations from doing this for 20 plus years is that you get more when you do the pair programming for your money and especially true when you look at the total cost of ownership.

Mark Balbes: So one, one thing you don’t see with these delivery principles, we don’t have any thou shall do pair programming, thou shall do continuous integration, thou shall, anything. We have our own beliefs in what makes our team successful, but they have a lot of autonomy in how they choose to work. So there are some things that we insist on because we just need them to manage the, our projects effectively and interact with our customer. So I talked about, status reporting, which is a boring thing, but you gotta do it. But our teams get to choose how they work.

Mark Balbes: And if they want to do KanBan process, if they want to do a, a SCRUM process for our internal teams where we’re managing them, that’s really up to them. But for the most part, you are going to see the hardcore pair programming test-driven development, continuous integration, continuous deployment if that’s possible we, will have CI/CD servers up and running. We have all the different kinds of tools to do the collaboration either physically or like a KanBan process.

Mobile Field Kit for the Department of Defense

Mark Balbes: One of the things I talked about Mobile Field Kit, I ran that for almost five years. That’s my kind of my baby. We had 24 linear feet of Kanban on three, eight- foot wide corkboards. Our entire process was mapped out on that. And we had other teams that are using, Trello or JIRA or something like that with big large screen monitors.

Company culture

Mark Balbes: The other thing we believe strongly in is co-location and what we’ve learned is that can be physical or virtual. So especially with COVID we already had what we called our virtual office. And so we didn’t talk about remote people. We talked about people in our virtual office and we treated our virtual office the same as our physical office there’s office managers, there’s policies around the virtual office, there are benefits to being in the virtual office that you wouldn’t necessarily get if you’re in a physical office. So for example, if you’re in a physical office, you would expect to have a desk. Somebody in our virtual office they have, they get a desk, things like that. And so when COVID hit, because we already had this virtual office concept set up and we had teams working effectively in it, we moved, we had a hundred people in the virtual office before COVID and we moved over 500 people into the virtual office in a weekend, and never missed a beat because we all knew how to work together. We already had those virtual tools that everybody was familiar with and yeah, and we just kept going. It was really pretty amazing. How well our agile capabilities helped us with dealing with COVID.

Bill Raymond: If anything comes out of this I’m happy to that we have a success story about COVID. Because those are those, there are, those are some tough times that it sounds like that was handled pretty well. I appreciate that you had already thought through all of that.

Bill Raymond: And I’m sure this is all part of some of your agile transformation work that you’ve been doing as well.

Mark Balbes: Yeah, our customers are dealing with the same thing. And so a lot of our experience up-front, we were able to help our customers do those same things and show them what we’re doing. But back to the topic at hand. We can’t assume that what works for us is gonna work for our customers. And so we can help, but we also have to adapt to their requirements.

Understanding your customer’s culture

Bill Raymond: When you talk about adapting to the customer and their environments, what are some of the challenges you see across industry? And I think you told me prior to this call that there’s a pretty wide variety of work that you do as well.

Mark Balbes: Yes. So I already talked about the Mobile Field Kit, which is one of the things we do for the Department of Defense. We have others. We build products for the quick service restaurant industry, fast food places. A lot of the pizza, mobile apps, if you’re using them, came from us and other companies like that that had to adapt very quickly to pick up delivery services, things like that.

Mark Balbes: When you’re dealing with the military, It is very different from dealing with quick service restaurants commercial customers. We do a lot with the banking industry where it’s heavily regulated and they tend to move slower. They can’t absorb changes fast.

Mark Balbes: There are You know, parts of those customers, they have divisions that are responsible for making sure that they’re maintaining their compliance. So they’re very resistant to any change and you have to be able to I won’t say overcome that resistance, but adapt to the resistance maybe is a better term.

Mark Balbes: You have to show them that they can still meet their requirements to make sure that the, the bank is meeting all of its obligations, because if they don’t, there could be huge financial penalties to those banks. And they’re also dealing with as they grow and these, the banks have consolidated over the last 20 years or so. They have different systems that work in different ways that have all been integrated together. So a lot of it is held together with these different integrations that you have to really understand the details of to know what’s going on and making changes to them is fraught with fear that you’re gonna think you’re making something better and you’re going to lose something in, a business rule or something in the process.

Mark Balbes: So banks can be really challenging to help them become more agile or even just in general, working with them on their software. It’s fun. It’s important. But it’s a different challenge from helping a a fast food chain, get their latest mobile app out and delight their customers. So those are some of the industries.

Bill Raymond: You’re stating very clearly that your objective is to do what the customer wants.

Bill Raymond: But there are things, as you said, you have some basic principles and standards that you use internally. So what happens when that gets shaken up? How do you address that?

Mark Balbes: Carefully. So there’s different ways of addressing it. One of the most important things when we’re working with a new customer is establishing trust. The faster, the more we can establish trust with the customer, the more we can do with them.

Mark Balbes: Occasionally we get a customer who’s we just met you. Great. Here’s a boatload of money. Let’s start up, a big team or five teams and let’s go! I wish they were all that way. But they’re not. And so typically when we’re working with customers initially the best thing we find is to start with some kind of a small engagement. Even though we could do something big and flashy and, fantastic for them.

Mark Balbes: Doing that successfully, without first doing something small means you’re risking that you don’t understand the culture, that you’re gonna have a mismatch, more opportunity for clashing with a part of their company that maybe we don’t even know exists until we hit that clash. And so finding something that that they’re excited about, but that’s small either building a capability for them or helping them to to build something for themselves and improve. And so a common engagement for us, initial engagement is what we call a subject matter expert engagement. Let’s take one of our, you know, senior people uh, with a lot of experience in the area that, that, that customer, you know, is in the domain they’re in banking, your fast food or whatever, and just have them go in and spend time with the customer, learning their environment, helping them understand where they can be better. What’s really important is helping them get some quick wins. It’s not about going in and assessing the customer and giving them a report card and telling ‘em, here’s all the things you’re doing wrong.

Mark Balbes: Because that, that doesn’t go over well. It’s about going in and saying, hey if we make this tweak to what you’re doing, you know, we’re gonna get some improvement. Let me do that for you. Let’s do that together and get that improvement. And that’s how a lot of our big work started was just do something small. But that’s, impactful.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, that’s interesting. I think, when we take a look at a lot of the agile frameworks out there. Almost all of them mentioned something along the lines of an MVP or an early win or, something that shows the value in what you’re doing. And that’s, it sounds like you’ve really embraced that idea.

Mark Balbes: It’s understanding what the customer wants too because some customers are, yes, please come in and help us get better. That’s what we want. And other customers don’t want that at all. They’re like, we, we think we have good processes. We know how we work. We need help with this technical problem, help us solve this technical thing or this business thing. And then we know to stay away from any kind of, process improvement or agile kind of talk with them, if that’s not what they’re already doing.

Bill Raymond: Have you encountered situations where the environment on the customer side is vastly different?

Bill Raymond: Maybe they’re using what we like to term, a waterfall method. Where everything gets planned up front. And there’s a schedule that we call a Gantt chart that shows every last task. Have you encountered those situations in these software development efforts?

Mark Balbes: Absolutely. A lot of times, it depends on the industry. So we’ve talked about the banking industry. They tend to be more conservative. They tend to be less agile in how they work. They want to know upfront how things are gonna work and whatnot. So the important thing is to recognize that agile i s not a methodology, right? It’s not SCRUM, it’s not Extreme Programming, it’s not SAFe. Agile is about the principles and the manifesto, so when you’re dealing with a customer who says, look, I’ve gotta have a high level design before you start working. Then, you know what? That is a requirement that is coming from the customer and you deal with that the way that you would deal with it in an agile process, there’s a requirement.

Mark Balbes: We’ll put the card on the board for the requirement and we’ll do that requirement. Now we’re going to recognize that doing some kind of high level design there’s a point of diminishing returns just from our experience, not just as being Agileists, but just expert software developers with all of our experience.

Mark Balbes: And so we will try to do the minimum necessary to satisfy the customer requirement. Obviously trying to make it as right, as possible, but then we’ll also want to prove out the design by doing some work. And so that’s where we can coach the customer about somebody like that is who’s asking for those designs.

Mark Balbes: What they’re trying to do is mitigate risk. It’s I wanna know that you guys know what you’re doing so that when you start building it, we’ve already thought through all the problems and we figured out what they are and how we’re gonna solve ‘em and we know that’s not true. You’re never gonna be able to do that.

Mark Balbes: Talking to the customer in their own language, talking to them about risk. We’ve got this high level design, let’s start working on an MVP or a prototype, whatever words resonate with them and prove out that design before we get too far. Guess what? Now you’re on the agile path of delivering something early and you give them that flavor for it and you can hopefully keep going in that direction.

Different working styles

Bill Raymond: When we talk about agile, is that teams. Should be as close to the customer as possible. Now, in this case, of course, the customers come to you and they’ve said we want to do this work. So that’s great. You’re gonna have that, that communication there, but the actual customer, the person or people using it, they might be somewhat separated from the team that you’re working on. How do you address that situation or do you make it a requirement that you are able to talk to these customers? What’s what are some of the methods that you use to make sure that you aren’t just following the words a, let’s say a, a small group assigned to work with you are saying versus the people that will use the product at the end?

Mark Balbes: Yeah. So first of all, I was on a project once that was building a medical application for a physician’s office. And the development team sat in a physician’s office. They gave us a conference room and that’s where we were doing the work. When. To talk about close that’s pretty close.

Mark Balbes: It’s a tough problem and so for us, ourselves, we have a product ownership team, we Have a user experience team that we can leverage for our engagement. So we are all in on wanting to be as close to the customer as possible, the user of the system to really understand how they’re thinking about it, how they want to use it and give a better experience than initially might have been thought possible. There are times when the client will say, we already know what we need for our customers, we don’t need to go to them. And that can be a problem because they’re stopping us from talking directly with the users of the apps. We’re giving demos to people who themselves aren’t getting the feedback that we would want from the right people. It’s a tough challenge because we have to maintain the relationship with our clients and they are, I’m not gonna say that they’re always right. But we have to make sure that they don’t feel like we’re going around them or undermining them or anything like that.

Mark Balbes: So we will try to work with them, suggesting, hey, how about if we go into the field and test this with real users or some mechanism to get that feedback, because invariably, when you do that, you find out that those people who think they know and are representing the customer don’t really know. And I’ve learned that from experience enough times.

Mark Balbes: So Mobile Field Kit coming back to that, my baby. One of my roles was basically acting as product owner on it, coming up with the features, driving the team to, build those features. And we were lucky that we got to go into the field, and actually train them on the system and see them using it in exercises. And it was amazing how many times little features that we threw in became like the star of the show and to us it was like, oh, this is just some small thing, we’re putting it in. And it becomes like, oh, this is the breakout thing that they want more of and more of. And if we had been left to our own devices, we would’ve thrown it in and never thought about it again, instead of it becoming now a big feature that we started building on. But once the users interact with the system it changes how they think about their role. So you can’t just take a snapshot in time and say, I know what my users want, because once you start giving them new tools, they start thinking about new ways of doing their job and wanting different features around that.

Bill Raymond: That’s a great story. It’s amazing. The little things that you find out that are so important like for example, I think accessibility is another one. Sometimes people have a hard time seeing the size of the font, but the people on the team, they didn’t have any problem with that. I know that’s becoming more and more of a problem for me.

Mark Balbes: With mobile devices you develop in the office, everything looks great. You walk outside, the sun is, shining down on the screen and you can’t see anything because it’s not a high contrast screen. And if you don’t ever walk outside and actually look at, where are your users actually using the application and see it in that environment, there’s things that you don’t realize you do an app for a, a manufacturing company and everything is great.

Mark Balbes: And then you go and you see it in the field and you realize that everybody’s got noise cancellation on their, headphones on their head and because it’s, so everything is so loud. And so all these great dings and beeps that you built into the system to let them know what’s going on. Nobody can hear those things.

Bill Raymond: Do you run into situations where you have the teams on your side developing the product. And then you also have another agile team on the other side that are also doing work on the same effort?

Mark Balbes: We have different models of engagement. The one that we’ve been talking about really are our internal teams, right? That’s the kind of perfect thing. We have our own processes, our own people. We can control a lot of things to be as effective as possible for our customers.

Mark Balbes: But there are other models of engagement where it may be that, we’re building a mobile app for our customer, but the customer has their own backend team building the services that our mobile app is calling into. In which case you’re coordinating with that team. So that’s one model. There’s a a model where we’re actually co-developing with the customer.

Mark Balbes: So it’s not just our people on the team. It’s our people with the customer’s people. And that can take different flavors because if the customer is interested in learning, having their people learn from us. We’ll actually be able to more closely follow our processes and have their people learn our processes so they can bring them back.

Mark Balbes: But sometimes it’s the other way. Sometimes the customer is basically we have our processes. There’s reasons that we do it this way because of our industry. It’s regulated it, whatever. In which case we have to adapt to how they are working, and that takes flexibility on our people’s part, because at that point they’re going from a very comfortable situation where they have a lot of autonomy and control to one where they’re working more, maybe more traditionally than we like to work, but that’s what’s needed.

Mark Balbes: The desire is that you use that to build trust with the customer, and they start to understand how we work and how we think about things and they trust us so that we can move them closer to a more agile model. Now, sometimes we work with a customer, we learn from them, right? The best thing is, situations like that, you go into with an open mind because, golly gee wouldn’t it be great to go in and discover they’re doing things that we didn’t know about. And that happens too.

Bill Raymond: Those are great moments. I will say there’s so many times when you’re in a situation where, you have some process that you thought was ideal and then the customer comes back and says, oh no look, this is an easier, better way. And you say, yeah, it is!

Mark Balbes: Yeah, we know our processes are as ideal as we’ve learned to make them for us. We are adapted to our kind of work when we do our internal stuff and we’ve learned that we have to be adaptable to our customers and their situation.

Bill Raymond: Yeah. And also, with that experience, that’s why people like to bring you on board I’m sure because they know that you have this wealth of background in different areas. So you bring some best practices that they might be interested in and then they’re gonna bring you some best practices that not only can you use with them, but you can start sharing those as long as they’re not under NDA, it start sharing those with other customers and they get value out of it.

Mark Balbes: Oh, absolutely. I can point to certain things that we do and it’s this is from that customer. And this is from that customer. It’s yeah, those are awesome. When that happens.

Wrap up

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I love those little moments, Mark Balbes, this is a great conversation. I really appreciate your time today. If anyone wants to reach out to you, how might they do that?

Mark Balbes: Oh, that can reach me at uh, LinkedIn. I’m the only Mark Balbes in the world. So it’ll be me.

Mark Balbes: I write a, a column. I say it’s monthly. But there’s some gaps for application development trends magazine called the agile architect.

Bill Raymond: Great. Yeah. And that’s how we found you. And they’re great articles. I really suggest that you go and check those out as well. Of course, your LinkedIn profile and the agile architect link will be in the agileinaction.com website.

Welcome to the podcast

-–

Bill Raymond: Hi and welcome to the podcast. Today, I’m joined by Lyssa Adkins, author of "Coaching Agile Teams," and an agile and leadership coach.

Introductions

-–

Bill Raymond: Hi, Lisa, how are you today?

Lyssa Adkins: Hi, I’m doing great. Thank you for the invitation and for this conversation, who knows where it’s going to go?

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I’m looking forward to it. We’re going to talk about how leaders create the space for agile to flourish today. But before we get started, could you introduce yourself?

Lyssa Adkins: Sure. I’m probably most well known for my work for over a decade in helping emerge the profession of agile coaching, and the discipline of agile coaching. And recently, I’ve been shifting my focus to where the greatest pain point is, which is leadership, leaders individually, and then collectively as leadership teams, and the shifts that they are being asked to make to be more of a match for this, you know, sort of confounding and volatile era that we’re in, and how that’s related to agile and just modern ways of working in general.

Bill Raymond: When we talk about agile transformation, very often, we just talk about a product team or a software team or IT.

How can leaders start to think differently?

-–

Bill Raymond: But it is expanding throughout the organization, and there is a different mindset that we have as a agile team and sometimes we expect leaders to act differently as well, and to understand what that means.

Bill Raymond: So could you maybe at a very high level to get started, talk about what that means from the context of this conversation we’re having today?

Lyssa Adkins: Yeah, I think what it means is that we start putting ourselves in the worldview in the context of what leaders care about. You know, we agileists for a long time have been you know, working at the team, the portfolio, the product level, you know, up to sort of director, senior, vice president sort of level in organizations pretty regularly.

But we haven’t really entered their world yet. And that’s what I have been attempting to do for the last several years, is enter their world and say, so, you know, if one of the goals is to deliver better and to deal with the constant change that’s happening through agile, if that’s one of the goals, then what’s the daily context that leaders care about that would have them clear the way for those goals to happen, for agile to flourish in their organization, and for them to be able to deal with the complex confounding world we’re in a little bit better?

Agile and Non-agile Team Differences

-–

Bill Raymond: We talk about this very frequently, what agile means, but could you share what an agile team looks like and what some of their focus is that might be different from if you will, maybe a non-agile team, and the differences between what they might expect from their leaders?

What is an Agile Team?

-–

Lyssa Adkins: Sure. So an agile team is one that is going to be in constant direct conversation and collaboration with the business people that want the thing they’re creating. An agile team is going to be delivering a piece of that actual business value on a regular cadence, let’s say every two weeks. They will be able to have real customers inspect that delivery of value, so that you can change when it’s cheap and you can adapt and actually build the thing the customer wants, rather than the thing we sort of imagined they wanted. And an agile team will be expecting to have no wait time, not waiting for things they need to come into the team and not waiting for the product that they make to hit the customer. That should just flow very, very smoothly.

Lyssa Adkins: So agile teams are going to expect that leaders are there to sort of take the ball of a big organizational impediment, that they will throw a leaders’ way.

Lyssa Adkins: Because one of the things that agile does, well, I often say this sort of tongue-in-cheek is that, you know, the only thing agile is guaranteed to deliver a hundred percent of the time are impediments. You know, and impediments are those things that make it so this team that has a charge to do something important for a customer doesn’t get stopped by the sort of the regular big machine sort of mechanical processes we’ve set up from the last century, that are still very much alive in many modern organizations.

Lyssa Adkins: So they’re going to expect leaders to number one, essentially, let them make a lot of decisions and stay out of the way of their value creation. Number two, come into the process at specific times, and there are specific times for leaders to do that, to give significant feedback, to make sure that the product is exactly hitting what we want in the marketplace.

Lyssa Adkins: And then number three, be Johnny-on-the-spot, like right there, to help clear those organizational impediments when they arise.

Lyssa Adkins: That’s the agile team and what they would sort of expect from leaders.

What is a Non-agile Team?

-–

Lyssa Adkins: A non-agile team is going to be a lot more passive. A non-agile team is essentially going to, you know, maybe the team members don’t work together in a concentrated block of time every day. Maybe they’re not directly connected to the business people, who are directly connected to the customers. You know, maybe they’re just sort of waiting to do their piece and hand it off to the next person. So you can already feel like even in the way of describing that, like how much more waiting there is, how much we’re used to making, as my husband likes to say, making a plan for a plan for a phase gate review, you how much we’re used to raising something that’s right in our way, we can’t do our work, but yet we know it’s not going to get addressed anytime soon, so we just sort of fill the time with other things. And there’s a lot of that sort of inefficiency that goes on in organizations, and is it most of the time, hidden by a veneer of busyness. So most leaders don’t know what’s even happening.

Project Management in Agile is Very Different

-–

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I can see that for sure. And, you know, I can tell you one of my aha moments in my personal career. You know, I’ve been in the project management business for a very long time, and as a project manager, my role was to be the intermediary between the project team and the sponsor. And very often it was a sponsor that made the decisions.

Bill Raymond: So I, as a leader in the project team, as a project manager, people would come to me and say, can I do this? We think we need that. The customer said they want this change. I have to go back and talk to the sponsor. And then the sponsor would say, I don’t like that idea, I do like this idea and we got sign off on each and every one of those things, and I bring it back to the team, sometimes the team was unhappy.

Bill Raymond: But when I moved into the agile world, frankly, the project manager’s role is very different. As a matter of fact, it’s kind of like hands off the agile team, and those agile teams are talking to the customers, as you said, and they’re saying, oh, the customer just told us that this isn’t going to work for them, so we are shifting on a dime and making a change, and there’s no, if you will, big project plan either.

Bill Raymond: And while the leader might have some say in what the team does, they’re usually not the ones making the decisions. it’s these agile teams that are doing that because they’re the ones that are closest to where the customer is.

Bill Raymond: So that was my big aha moment.

Agile is a Very Disorienting World

-–

Lyssa Adkins: Well, I mean, I think it’s an amazing aha you’re having there. The thing I want to highlight about it is that agile is a very disorienting world. The agile way of working much better matches this volatile and uncertain time we’re in that’s actually, frankly, not projected to get any better anytime soon.

Lyssa Adkins: In fact, you know, maybe even change is going to be on a even more steep exponential curve, right? So agile works beautifully with it, but you see how disorienting the two things are. Like you talked about not like a baby step forward from one to the next, you talked about two completely different worlds.

Lyssa Adkins: And I think that the thing I would add to this is, I recently was asked to do a keynote, and it was for leaders of supply organizations to a big multinational corporation. And they wanted to know, OK, it sounds like agile just lets us change all the time and that doesn’t feel very safe. So how can we react and work with all these changes that are happening and still sort of have some semblance of where we’re going, and still sort of have some way of knowing that it’s going to turn out OK. And there’s two things I want to pull apart here. Number one, no one will guarantee that anything is going to turn out OK. And I think if leaders are looking for that, that’s the thing they’re going to have to start doing, their own inner work on to deal with the fact that we’re in an era where everything’s falling away, everything you counted on is falling away. So that’s a bit, no one’s going to guarantee it’s going to be OK.

There are Safety Harnesses Built Into Agile

-–

Lyssa Adkins: However, there is safety in metabolizing all of these changes using the agile practices, principles, and values. That agile actually creates safety for us to do that. And while everything else is falling away, while you can’t guarantee that the next change that’s going to rock your whole organization, you can’t guarantee how that’s going to happen or what that’s going to do, you can build safety in using the agile pieces to metabolize that change, and no matter what the change is, get something good out of it.

Lyssa Adkins: There are these safety harnesses built in to the way agile works. And I think what happens is that unfortunately, when agile comes into a lot of large organizations, those safety harnesses get taken out, right? And so this is like, I just really want to impress upon people, if you do the agile frameworks as intended, you’ve got the safety for adapting to change built in.

Bill Raymond: So far, what you shared was that there needs to be a shift in mindset. And we’ve also talked a little bit about the fact that the leaders will trust their teams to be working with the customers on a regular basis, and that they will be focused on delivering what those customer needs are.

Bill Raymond: So there’s maybe a little less, if you will, if we do that comparison between the old and the new way, there’s sort of a new level of trust that happens between the leaders and the teams. And there’s a lot of this concept of, you know, solving problems, closing impediments, I think is actually the words you used, and fixing those issues.

Strategic Perspective for a Leader

-–

Bill Raymond: But, what about from the strategic perspective? Because of course, I could imagine, you know, as a leader that’s something that I struggle with on a regular basis. What am I leaving the teams to do versus how do I think about moving the company forward?

Bill Raymond: Could you talk a little bit about that?

Lyssa Adkins: Well, so far, I think our conversation is talking about teams that deliver value inside of organizations, sort of maybe the one or two levels of leaders above that.

Lyssa Adkins: I think there’s a lot for those leaders. I think those leaders that are in direct contact with teams, there’s certified agile leadership courses, there’s all kinds of things that help them understand how to use agile to their advantage. Who I’m really interested in, are the executive leaders of an organization that by and large, are not that involved with teams on a daily basis.

Lyssa Adkins: And yet what happens in organizations, is as agile continues to proliferate, as we start to get some good return from using it, then at some point it hits this glass ceiling in an organization. And that glass ceiling is usually the top leadership team, because that top leadership team is behaving in a frame of reference that is completely different than the rest of the organization now.

Lyssa Adkins: And the rest of the organization will absolutely be stopped by the level of consciousness and mental complexity of that top team. that’s where I think like the biggest bottleneck for using agile well is right now.

Mental Complexities of the Leadership Team

-–

Bill Raymond: Yeah, so could you talk a little bit about what those complexities are?

Lyssa Adkins: Yeah, obviously, different for every leadership team and every leader, but as a general idea, what top leadership teams are faced with now, is that the way they have coped and the way they have thrived up to this point, no longer holds.

Lyssa Adkins: And if individuals think it does hold, after one or two conversations, they could start to say like, oh yeah, now that you’re asking me questions, Lyssa, I’m actually letting in how volatile and uncertain things are. I get how it doesn’t really hold anymore.

Lyssa Adkins: And so these top leaders come to sort of the same realization honestly, that agile teams come to, which is that we cannot control any of this, that the empirical process is our best hope. And for leaders even more is at stake. So much is at stake because of the way we’ve organized our economic activity, the way the stock market expects certain things.

I have such compassion for leaders who understand that their way of leading is not working as well as it used to. And yet at the same time, they’re up against the same sort of demands and stresses that they have been up against for a long time. Yet it doesn’t seem to be working well anymore.

The Inside Job

-–

Lyssa Adkins: This is where the job becomes an inside job, you know, inside of each leader, and then more importantly, collectively with how that leadership team functions. So let’s just start with inside every leader first.

Lyssa Adkins: The inside job is to radically expand one’s mental complexity, to become a match for the complexity of the problems and situations we’re in on a daily basis in business these days.

Lyssa Adkins: And so what that means practically, let’s just take an example of like, well, there’s so many supply chain failures right now, so let’s just take a supply chain failure example. That’s pretty common, right?

Lyssa Adkins: So as a supply chain failure, you can’t get a key component that you need to make your product. The way we handle that right now, as leaders and as a leadership team, is we just sort of pile on the pressure. We’re like, make it happen, you know, we go into like massive overworked firefighting mode and we just continue to force. And that is one way of dealing with it, and maybe a useful way in a short term situation. But if we’re going to be encountering those sorts of failures over and over and over again, then it might be worth taking the time and looking at it from lots of different perspectives.

Lyssa Adkins: And so one of the most disorienting questions for leaders that is really useful to them is something like, what are these supply chain failures trying to tell you? Questions like, what is trying to happen here? If you were to take the perspective of your supplier, what would you see? If you were to take the perspective of the relationship system that your organization and all of your suppliers are in, what’s happening there that might be clues?

Lyssa Adkins: These are ways to expand one’s range of possibilities to create new points of view. I realize this is still sounding so abstract, because it’s just so different for each leader in each leadership team, but there is absolutely this beautiful instrument that helps leaders see what their leadership impact actually is, compared to what they think it is.

-–

Lyssa Adkins: And it helps them move from this sort of predict-and-plan mentality that used to work, you know, quite a bit better, to a more sense-and-respond mentality, which is exceptionally uncomfortable. I’m telling you, I’m in it every day myself, it’s super uncomfortable, but it’s more of a match for the volatility.

Keeping Yourself Thinking Differently

-–

Bill Raymond: As a leader, there’s this expectation that things are moving forward and you have excellent communication with your teams. So when a big change happens, like suddenly the supplier. I can’t deliver as promised. One of the things that might happen and go through your head is I already made commitments based on what the supplier committed.

Bill Raymond: And I already made commitments because my team said that we can make these dates. And now there’s a sense that you have to do something about it. And I think that puts you into this fight or flight mode.

Bill Raymond: Now you have to start pushing to get things back on track. And what you’re saying is, well, yes, sometimes you do just have to push. You have to push hard.

Bill Raymond: As you said, sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn’t. But here’s the big problem is if you start to go down that path, it’s hard to step back and think differently.

Bill Raymond: Do you have any ideas, concepts, approaches that someone might take as a leader to think differently about the challenge at hand?

Lyssa Adkins: Yeah, I sure can, and I want to start by challenging the notion that it all worked before.

Lyssa Adkins: Because it didn’t. So you and I are long time project managers, we know what happens, we know what happens. You know, things do not go according to plan, even when we were in a simpler world where change was not exponential, things did not go according to plan at all, but we sort of drove the system to just deal with it somehow. And so by the time information gets to an executive leader, they don’t necessarily see the duck going like crazy with the little feet under the water. They see something that looks smooth. It never was, it never was.

Lyssa Adkins: And so this idea that we can hold back the tide by holding back change and holding back reality has always been sort of like a veneer that we put on top of what was really going on. So that’s the first thing to challenge, is the notion that it actually did work before. And if it did work before, on whose back did it work?

Lyssa Adkins: So that’s like an interesting question to look at. And given that the pace of change is now exponential, that change is pervasive and perpetual, I love that new definition from Aneel Chima and Ron Guttman. They have a Harvard business review article that just captured my attention.

Lyssa Adkins: They said, Look, change itself is different now. We are in an era where change is pervasive, meaning it’s happening in multiple parts of your organization, multiple parts of your own life simultaneously. It’s perpetual, meaning we don’t get the rest between big changes anymore like we used to. We don’t get the sort of, Oh, it’s a big change, OK, we get to rest for a little bit and integrate that. It’s like change after change after change, we don’t get to get off the change bus, in other words. We’re on the ride.

Lyssa Adkins: And the third is, that change is exponential. The actual pace of change itself is increasing.

So given those conditions, a really useful thing for a leader to do is to allow themselves to feel the pain of it. So just imagine how many executive leaders don’t want to go here, and just imagine how useful it would be if more of them did.

Lyssa Adkins: And so this is the work I do, is I help executive leaders actually face the pain of trying to continue to apply things that used to work better, and they’re just doing it a little bit harder, and maybe a little bit harder now, maybe with a little bit more force, and yet things are still falling away.

Techniques to Help with Change

-–

Bill Raymond: And so what are some of the techniques that you use to help with that?

Lyssa Adkins: Well, I think one of the biggest things that’s useful for leaders is to get some objective data about how their leadership is impacting the people in their organization, how it’s impacting their organization’s goals and targets, and how it’s impacting them. And so for that, I use just, I think it’s a really fantastic instrument called, The Leadership Circle Profile. It shows you in no uncertain terms the gap between your self perception of your leadership and the perception of everyone else that you interact with. And the leaders who get the most out of this ask their customers and suppliers to also be part of the 360 evaluation. So that’s one thing, it’s like, get some objective data, have a way to create a pathway for yourself.

Lyssa Adkins: Because otherwise, you’re just sort of swimming in this notion that, oh yeah, we’re being asked to be agile leaders, we’re being asked to be 21st century leaders, what the heck does that mean? And what it means practically to a leader, at the director level and below, is really different than what it means practically to an executive leader. Because an executive leader is dealing with things in a totally different, you know, just a different scale all the time, right?

Lyssa Adkins: Once you have that sort of language, that model, that pathway, it can create, then some really interesting coaching can happen around the leader’s actual issues. So leaders will come with an issue of like, here’s what’s happening in the market, here’s the change that’s happened, you know, here’s what I’m trying to do about it.

Lyssa Adkins: When we do coaching around those sorts of topics, it’s not just general. It’s now referring back to what the leader is already getting in touch with related to their own leadership and how they react to things like that, versus how they create outcomes.

Lyssa Adkins: That’s one of the big shifts that this leadership circle profile helps people do. It’s called, moving from problem-reacting to outcome-creating.

Being Outcome-driven from an Agile Perspective

-–

Bill Raymond: Can you talk a little bit about outcomes. This is a conversation that I think we have fairly frequently on the podcast, but very often when we’re talking about this outcome-driven mindset, we’re usually talking at a team level. And I am curious to maybe pick your brain around what that means when you’re at an executive leadership level, what does it mean to be outcome-driven?

Bill Raymond: Because I think we can all say, yeah, I’m outcome-driven, of course, I mean, my sales numbers are tied to that or, you know, my bonus is tied to that. What does this look like from an agile perspective?

Lyssa Adkins: So of course, a leader has organizational outcomes they’re going for. And in every specific instance, every specific issue or problem they’re dealing with, there’s always the opportunity to, instead of being run by sort of the problem-reacting mode, which in essence is a mode to reduce our own anxiety, although most of us,even in executive leadership now we’re still run by that kind of mode.

Lyssa Adkins: Instead of being run by that mode, there’s a possibility to stop and say, OK, this is a really difficult confounding situation. Let me ask myself some questions or maybe let me get someone else to help ask me these questions. Questions like, in this specific situation, what am I committed to creating? In this specific situation, what is the higher good that’s trying to happen? Now, the reason you would ask yourself questions like that, is because you’re trying to open up more possibilities for working with the change and the turbulence that’s happening.

Lyssa Adkins: When a leader asks themselves or a peer or a coach asks the leader, so what is the outcome you’re committed to creating here? They might say something like, I need to create more leaders in my organization. Because we don’t have enough people who are just able to run with the ball. OK. They might say, I need to create a better capacity for working with supply chain interruptions, and I’m noticing that that might mean the expansion or the creation of something new in the organization, right?

Lyssa Adkins: So their concerns become much more of like, if they look out across their organization, sort of like a lab scientist, like a scientist in their lab might look across their organization. It’s like, so what’s a little piece that needs to be tuned here, what’s the missing piece there, what’s, you know, those sorts of things are really useful for an executive leader to focus on. Many executive leaders focus on solving the problem of the day. And that’s going to continue to just keep us in the loop of firefighting, making the machine work at all costs, you know, and we’re finding out that employees are no longer willing to be that cost, so that’s even falling away. The idea of becoming outcome-creating is well, it’s whatever it means to an individual leader in a given situation.

Lyssa Adkins: But the more leaders work with this, the more they start to look at building capacity and capability in their organization, more than hitting a thing.

Bill Raymond: It’s maybe at a larger scale, but it still is very similar to the way we talk about this with teams. For example, I know that one of the biggest challenges that agile teams have, doesn’t matter what part of the organization they’re in, marketing, sales, software development, doesn’t matter, you know, one of the biggest challenges that the teams have, is people come to them and say, do this thing. And what they’re looking for is the value. What is the problem that you’re trying to solve? What’s the value that this is going to provide and start thinking about that more holistically.

Bill Raymond: I liked your examples that you used you have a supply chain problem. That problem means that you’re not going to produce what your customers need and it needs to be solved. So you have a few options. Now, I know my answer would be, well, let’s just find more suppliers. But really, what I need to be thinking about is, how do I have a leadership team that works with me, and tell them that problem that we’re having, this supply issue, and have them come up with some interesting solutions. It might be ultimately what you thought would happen, but they might have some other ideas that you hadn’t come up with.

Lyssa Adkins: That’s another way that this is a parallel process to what agile teams go through, just at a different level of impact, just at a different level of scope. It’s so interesting that when I started working with leadership teams, I had this sort of hypothesis that they would have similar team dynamics issues and similar level of competency in things like conflict and whatnot that delivery teams have. Which is to say, we’re all getting better at it. No one is great at most of these team dynamics things.

The Five Core Competencies

-–

Lyssa Adkins: Well, what I found out was that yes, they have that, and in fact, maybe it’s a little bit less competent than your average delivery team. So one of the things I’ve started to really talk about with leadership teams a lot, just to create sort of like a frame around this, is that you have these goals that you have, these OKRs targets, whatever you call them. The way we achieve these in a leadership team is we have a lot of conversations. We make decisions. We have work sessions, right?

Lyssa Adkins: The way those work sessions, decisions and conversations happen, is through five core competencies that every team has to have: collaboration, creativity, conflict, change, and choice-making. So five CCs, five core competencies that just remember them easily for me. And then further than that, what’s really underneath all of that, is the web of relationships and the health or the lack of health of that leadership team’s relationship system, such that they can build those competencies.

Lyssa Adkins: So if we can increase the literal level of competence in those things, then decisions happen easier and they stick longer. Then we can move through work sessions easily without a lot of drag of, you know, poor conversation dynamics. Then as you just said, team members can bring creative ideas to the problem we’re trying to face. We can all be asking ourselves, what are we committed to creating here? Not just, how do we solve this problem, right?

Lyssa Adkins: And then of course, the lift happens through all of these things and then targets and OKRs and all those things get met easier and get trued up to reality more often.

Lyssa Adkins: And I think that’s a key piece of it as well. We start to let reality in more often.

Bill Raymond: I really appreciate your time today, Lyssa. This has been a great conversation. If anyone wants to reach out to you to talk about this further, how might they do that?

Lyssa Adkins: I suggest visiting my website and using contact us. You can also see the sorts of things I’m up to there. There’s lots of podcasts and interviews and all that sort of stuff. It’s at LyssaAdkins.com, but you have to know how to spell it. It’s L Y S S A A D K I N S .com

Bill Raymond: Thank you for that. And I absolutely will make sure that the link for that gets on the agileinaction.com website. Just look up this conversation with Lyssa Adkins. And of course, if you’re listening to this in a podcast player app right now, just scroll down to the show notes or the description, and you’ll see the link there for LyssaAdkins.com.

Hi, this is Bill Raymond. It is August 2nd, 2022, and I am excited to make a few announcements. The first and most important announcement is that we have grown to over 10,000 listeners.

Thank you!

I want to thank the team who helps deliver a quality podcast every week. And of course, I want to thank you, our listener. We hope to continue providing you with a podcast that is valuable for your personal career growth and helps people in organizations think differently about how we work and interact with each other.

A big milestone!

Another exciting announcement that I want to share with you is that we are celebrating our two year anniversary this month. I created the Agile in Action with Bill Raymond podcast because the terms agile and agility can mean many things. And many people think that agile is a term used for software development and indeed the roots of that specific term come from that community. When you listen to this podcast, you will almost certainly hear from people in the software community, but you will also hear how agile concepts run across many different disciplines.

You can hear James Plunkett at Citizens Advice. Talk about agile for government policy development.  I have also interviewed Andrea Fryrear, as we talk about agile for marketing, and Loreal Jiles, who shares the benefits of adopting agile techniques in finance organizations. Agile and agility is a movement that continues to build steam in the workplace. Organizations that recognize the value in small teams, building great things are the ones that will benefit the most. And I want to help you understand how that works in practice.

Of course smaller, more autonomous teams are just one component of the change required to implement agility. Teams need to thrive in the workplace, which is why Dr. Tracy Browers shares her ideas on that very same topic. Linda Varrell talks about dealing with ambiguity in the workplace. And just recently Alla Weinberg shares how you can create a place of psychological safety in the workplace.

All our podcasts are free of charge from wherever you get your podcasts. You can even listen to our podcasts on the agileinaction.com website.

Introducing transcripts

Now earlier I mentioned, I have a few big announcements. As if 10,000 viewers and a two year anniversary, weren’t enough, we are excited to announce that we are providing a feature many of you have asked for, and that is transcriptions. Moving forward, when you go to a podcast on the agileinaction.com website, you will see the transcriptions for any new podcasts. And let’s starting with the July 26 , 2022 podcast titled the leaders mindset required for organizational agility and that’s with Dr. Thomas Grisham.

Call for guests

Another announcement is that we are looking for guests that have a passion for organizational change, agility, team development, leadership, and modernization. If you are that person or know someone that is just send me an email at bill.raymond@agileinaction.com.

That’s bill.raymond@agileinaction.com, one word.

Want to support the community?

If you’re interested in being part of our growing community of 10,000 plus listeners and have a product or service that you think our audience will be interested in, use that same email address of bill.Raymond@agileinaction.com.

Finally, I would like to ask you for a favor. If you’re listening to this podcast right now in an app and it’s safe to do so, please rate the podcast with five stars. And if you have the time, write a quick review, those two kind acts help us in growing the community and keeping the podcast going.

So that is it. We now have 10,000 subscribers and are celebrating a two year anniversary and we will be providing transcripts for all future podcasts on the agileinaction.com website.

Full Transcription

Bill Raymond: Hi and welcome to the podcast. Today, I’m joined by Dr. Thomas Grisham - agilist, consultant, and author. Hi Thomas, how are you today?

Thomas Grisham: Doing fine, Bill. How are you?

Introductions

-–

Bill Raymond: I’m doing great. We’re going to be talking about the mindset required for organizational agility. Before we get into that, could you please share a little bit about yourself?

Thomas Grisham: Sure I’d be happy to. I’m going to share with you what the past four decades have given me the opportunity to learn, and it comes from global endeavors primarily. Consulting and education for 400 or so organizations, ranging from, the United Nations to General Motors in 84 countries, and a whole lot of research to try and figure out what was right and what was wrong with all of what I had experienced.

What is ‘organizational agility’

-–

Bill Raymond: We could talk about agile and agility all day long, and I think everyone has their own definition for that.

Bill Raymond: So maybe what you could share, just to kind of put some context for this conversation, you can share what you mean by organizational agility and what it kind of means to have that mindset. So if we can start there and then we can drill into it a bit more.

Thomas Grisham: Okay. What it means in the 21st century, is that the organization is as flat as possible, you need to be as nimble as possible because change is going to be consistent.

Just look at the world today. The third law of thermodynamics says that any system, including organizations, tends to move in a direction of chaos. And if you look at Ukraine and trying to do business in Russia and trying to do business in the EU, today, any company is going to be challenged by that. Even if you have a perfectly agile organization, you’re going to have to adapt to things that you did not anticipate.

Thomas Grisham: So an agile organization to me, is an organization that is as small as possible, that is as anticipatory as possible, meaning, you need to be aware of politics, finance, economic, technical issues, who’s doing what. You need to have a broader view so that you can see things coming before they happen and maybe make an adjustment to go around them rather than have them stop whatever it is you’re doing.

XLQ

-–

Thomas Grisham: To be able to do that, it requires basically three things, which is, I call it Cross-cultural Leadership, XLQ, which is X for cross-cultural, L for leadership, Q for intelligence.

Thomas Grisham: If you make too many mistakes, you’ll spend all of your time cleaning up while the world has changed four more times and you’re cleaning up the wrong mistakes. There is no perfect fix for this, but the idea is, if you’re flatter and if you’re not overworking your people, they have an opportunity to think and just take a walk and imagine, what might this have to do with people that are my colleagues in other locations and them on me? If the organization is hierarchical, it means that all the communications, the vision and strategy, and all have to trickle down all the way through the organization.

Organizations work horizontally

-–

Thomas Grisham: Organizations don’t work that way. They work horizontally, matrix idea. And so the communications, the functional communications go laterally. The visions and the values go vertically. That doesn’t work. That will not make you agile, it will make you the other thing. And so the three pieces, as I said, are leadership, top to bottom.

Thomas Grisham: Communication and knowledge sharing, so that knowledge is shared quickly. And I don’t mean weekly, I mean daily, across an organization, top to bottom, side to side.

Communication channels

-–

Thomas Grisham: If you think about the old formula, any of you that took the PMP training sessions to get your credential, n x n - 1 is the number of communication modes, if you would. So if you have an organization that let’s say, has 10,000 people in it, n x n - 1, a lot of communication channels out there. If you’re communicating by email, it’s not possible. It’s simply not possible. You cannot send and receive that many, let alone read them.

Thomas Grisham: And so, it requires a level of technology, a comfort with technology from top to bottom, not just the IT guys, that enables you to use the technical resources to reduce the amount of time that people have to spend dealing with communications. Just simple communications.

Thomas Grisham: When I ask people, Bill, around the planet, how many emails do you get a day? For example, one of my friends was a VP in Dubai. I met him in the elevator, bumped into him, As-salamu alaykum, I ask him, how many of these do you get a day?

Thomas Grisham: He says, oh, at 300-400, and this is the president of a company. And I said, what do you do with them? He said, I delete them. So you communicate with these guys. He says, if it’s important, they’ll call me. That’s a fairly crude way to go at this. But the answer to that question that I’ve gotten in dozens and dozens of countries is, most people will get hundreds of emails a day. And then you add in the text messaging on top of that.

Thomas Grisham: So if you just do the math, you can’t cope with it. You can’t do some work, go to some meetings and answer all this stuff in the course of a day. If your world changes daily, by the time you get today’s emails done tomorrow, now you got tomorrow’s emails, so it’s a never-ending cycle of things that shouldn’t be pulling on time people spend, because people’s time is worth a lot.

Thomas Grisham: And so between technology and leadership, the communication and knowledge needs to flow easily through a company. And so for companies like, oh think of the Swedish guys. Their internet company, the challenge they had was that they were having people learning lessons in Kenya that were really important to the overall company and needed to get that information from Kenya to Japan. And the problem was, again, if it goes email up the chain, across, down, by the time they get it, it’s old, it’s stale. Shelf life’s gone.

Thomas Grisham: And so the key to it is, you have to be as fast doing what you do as the speed of changes. That is not designed for 21st-century organization. You can’t do this hierarchically.

Hire people that share your vision and values

-–

Thomas Grisham: I’ve seen enough companies try it, big companies like Lufthansa, and I’ve seen them go at this from four or five different ways with different divisions to see, okay, how can we sort this out? And the problem always comes back to, it’s dependent upon the three things that I mentioned. And for people, the assets, did you hire people that share your vision and your values?

Well, no, because we couldn’t communicate it to the HR guys because they’re in the United States, you know, and that kind of thing.

Thomas Grisham: And so the dilemma here is that these things are all interconnected. You can’t just separate them out and put them in nice little piles. They’re all interconnected.

Change Fatigue

-–

Thomas Grisham: But the idea is, the board of directors and the CEO set the vision and the values. Those shouldn’t change weekly.

Bill Raymond: Mm.

Thomas Grisham: Those need to be in place for at least a year. Should be looking five years out so that people have something to hold onto. Too much change, change fatigue, is a really horrible thing for an agile organization. It’s exactly what you do not want.

Bill Raymond: Mhm.

Thomas Grisham: And so in order to anticipate and to avoid, you have to have some anchor.

Thomas Grisham: The anchor is the vision and the values. They can adjust, but they shouldn’t change. And that’s usually five years, then it percolates down to the CEO, the C-suite people, etcetera, etcetera, depending on how the organization is structured.

Thomas Grisham: Think about it this way. Let’s say you’re the CEO of a company, and you’ve just realized that the United States government has issued a sanction on the products that you sell to Russia. And it’s going to go in effect next Tuesday. And imagine that you’ve got some product in, you know, being shipped some project in design, some in manufacturing, scattered all over the chain. If you’re a global company, you may be manufacturing in seven other countries. So you got all this mess out there going on and you realize, uhoh, government just changed the rules.

Flexibility of hierarchical organizations

-–

Thomas Grisham: Okay. How many people need to know this? Let’s imagine it’s hundreds, just for sake of discussion. Okay. So you’re the CEO, you just got word of this from your lobbyist in Washington, and you need to get the word out. And let’s assume in your organization, there are 10,000 people and let’s assume that 200 of them need to know. But there’s also 200 that need to know that are not in your organization, they’re in other organizations that are subcontractors and consultants to you.

Thomas Grisham: How do you get the word out, quickly and efficiently, so that everybody gets the same idea? Because you know, the old plan that you tell Sam and Sam tells Jill and Jill tells Tom and then Tom repeats it to Fred. Fred hears something different.

And so if you think about it, the most efficient way would be, if you, as the CEO could turn to one person and say, Bill, let everybody know. Okay, I’m done, now it’s Bill’s turn. Okay. Bill’s got it now. Bill’s still got 200 people out there.

Thomas Grisham: In a hierarchical organization, Bill tells Tim, Fred, and Sam. Now Bill’s done. Tim, Fred and Sam tells. (inaudible) So you can picture how this has to cascade down.

Thomas Grisham: By the time everybody who needs to know this gets the message, the products are already in Russia. Now you got a different problem.

Thomas Grisham: So in an agile organization, when I said flat, what I mean is Bill, for example, would turn to four people who have four people working for them and four people working for them, that kind of thing. Because four, six people, the research says is about the limit for CEO.

Thomas Grisham: I’ve seen CEOs with 12 and 18, it doesn’t work terribly well. There’s too many people.

Thomas Grisham: And so if you think, just dividing the organization into fours or sixes, that kind of thing, and then think through the numbers, the idea is you have to empower each one of those levels with more authority and responsibility.

Thomas Grisham: So it’s not just Bill in charge of design of products, it’s Bill in charge of R&amp;D, design of projects, manufacturing of projects and customer service. That means Bill has got to be a pretty darned good guy. So when you hire him, he needs to have a broad set of skills so that he can function in those positions.

Thomas Grisham: So in a perfect world, you have the design, you know what each position requires and you acquire that asset. In the real world, where you have a hierarchical organization that needs to be more flexible.

Small as possible without overwork

-–

Thomas Grisham: My idea is, you go through the same math. How can I make this as small as possible, but still not overwork people. Come up with some numbers, come up with a basic design and then set just like you would for a strategy, a board of directors, five-year strategy, CEO’s job, and the people in the organization are tasked with a one-year tactical plan.

Thomas Grisham: How do we build for one year, what we need to build in order to achieve five years of the strategic plan? And then you adjust as you need to, during the 12 months. Each month you take a look.

Dual responsibilities

-–

Thomas Grisham: So you go back and you look at a way to make one first step. We need, let’s take the Operations group and let’s merge it with R&amp;D. Just as an example. And so we’re going to give those people dual responsibilities. You may have technical layout guys, for example, if you’re a pharmaceutical firm, you may have technical geneticists, for example, that you hire, but you don’t want three layers on top of them. So that if they see a problem, for example, oh, we’re starting on this genetic test, but the problem was, we just realized that there’s a new variant to the virus out there. Oh my God, should we stop? Should we continue? What should we do?

Thomas Grisham: In order for a decision to be made that quickly, somebody has to know how to interpret what they’re saying.

I’m sorry, I’m not a geneticist, I’m a finance guy, what the hell are you talking about? And then the technical guys and the geneticists say, I don’t know, what are you talking about with cash flow, you know?

Thomas Grisham: So the dilemma is what you need are a couple of layers of people who are more like a Renaissance woman, someone who’s trained with one background, but has been put into the system.

Thomas Grisham: Give you one example, 3M, the company that makes sticky stuff, they move people from accounting into R&amp;D. Why in the hell would you do that as a company? And the reason is. Because they walk in with stupid questions. What does this do? And instead of giving them an explanation of, well, yeah, just the polymetric structure of this and the chemistry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. No, no, my question is, what does it do? Does it stick for good or is it like a Post-It note where it comes off?

Thomas Grisham: And likewise, the R&amp;D guys that go into bookkeeping got no clue. But what happens at the end of it is, now you have a different world year.

Global View with Local Heart

-–

Thomas Grisham: One more example, quickly. We, like all companies, and here’s another difficulty for global guys. I want to build a new team in India. We’re going to open an office. Okay, question is, do you hire an Indian guy and train him to think like a global guy or do you take an American guy and train him in the culture of India? We answer that question by saying, we’ll take an Indian guy and put global goggles on him.

Thomas Grisham: So they sent him to me, I trained him, we sent him to, I was in Thailand, we sent him to Korea. We sent him back into India. Now you have a global view with a local heart.

Thomas Grisham: And the idea now is that instead of needing two people, for example, a Western person, who’s got the global standards and connection to the board of directors and all of that in her head, and a local person who understands the culture and how politics in the economy works in India.

Thomas Grisham: And you put two of them in. That would be a typical hierarchical approach. In a more virtual, more changing world that’s more flexible, agile, you just want one.

Thomas Grisham: And so the question is, which way do you go with this? Those are the kind of dilemmas Bill, that everyone faces, no matter what business they’re in. The only difference that businesses make is that things that the United Nations does, compared to Lufthansa. The businesses they work in just require different skillsets and different kinds of backgrounds and language skills, things like that.

Fewer People with More Responsibility

-–

Thomas Grisham: So that’s the way I see this again, to repeat is, to be more agile and flexible, you need to be as flat as you can be, which means you need to have fewer people with more responsibility and more authority, within the boundaries of what you can accomplish.

Thomas Grisham: You know, I’m telling you what the perfect world looks like. You need to have quick, easy communications across the organizations.

Thomas Grisham: I’ll give you an example, there was a group I was doing training for in Beijing, this R&amp;D company. And they had a couple thousand people scattered around the planet doing different kinds of things, but they had all come together. So this was training on how to do agile from Beijing. True agile, you know, no paper, no schedules, no estimates, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.

Thomas Grisham: How do we have teams in six different time zones doing this? They had figured that out heading down, and what they found is that they built themselves a hub. So that instead of me emailing seven people in six time zones, you need to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you simply like a tweet, put it up on a hub.

Thomas Grisham: Now everybody can see everybody’s comments all at the same time. There’s one communication. That simplified their life. So they used the technology to make sure that the communications took almost no time at all. It was super quick.

Thomas Grisham: So you can do it, but you have to have the goal in mind, which is, I want everybody to know everything. I want complete transparency. You know, it’s not even possible to do that, but that’s the goal. That’s the vision that you sort of strive toward.

Thomas Grisham: And then the third thing again, is the people.

PhD vs Engaged

-–

Thomas Grisham: One more quick example, if I can.I was hired to do, the first piece of technology done in the United States is a piece of Finnish technology. Never done here before. So all brand new stuff, you know, cutting edge. So I was working at a university, I got off the plane, went to visit with a chancellor. Chancellor said, great to have you, pick anybody you want, they’re all starving college kids, you know. They work for free. Okay. Where’s the engineering school, I said? And his eyes got kind of wide and his mouth fell open.

He said, I don’t have an engineering school. I have arts, I have medicine.

Thomas Grisham: So I thought, okay, how am I going to fulfill my first idea here, which is the assets need to be right? What I ended up with was a road scholar in Italian art, a PhD in psychology and another collection of crazy, unusual people.

Thomas Grisham: I thought, I’m toast, this is not going to work.

Thomas Grisham: But what I found out was, they came in just like the 3M story. They came in each day and said to me, hey, here’s a picture of this thing, I just saw it. What does this do? Ah, endlessly curious, endlessly interested and engaged.

Thomas Grisham: What I learned was, I don’t need PhDs in electronics. I need people who are wanting to come to work because they’re happy and because they’re engaged in what they do. I can’t wait to get there tomorrow, I hope something changes, I sure would hate to do the same thing two days in a row.

Thomas Grisham: You can do it, but it requires the leadership, the XLQ to know. My definition of leadership is the ability to inspire the desire to follow. People choose who they follow.

Thomas Grisham: And the second piece is to inspire achievement beyond expectations. And what I mean is, the expectations of the person who I’m leading. So if I work for Bill and Bill knows Tom’s not the brightest tack in the box, he could be a whole lot better at writing code than he is. And you give me a new piece of work to do, and I’m terrified. You can tell. But you support me. You let me experience it, you permit me to fail if I have to. That requires the kind of leadership that the C-suite people need to see and imbue in an organization. That’s not easy.

Bill Raymond: No, it’s definitely not. And then I think about the fact that, you know, very often when we’re talking about organizational agility, when we get to companies that are that size of 10,000 or larger, globally-dispersed, the number of levels in the organization seems to increase exponentially.

What does a flat organization look like in terms of numbers?

-–

Bill Raymond: And so you’re talking about keeping as flat a level of organization as possible. What’s that number? What does that number look like? Because I can think of any number of companies, 10,000 or over where the number of levels is at least 12, if not more.

Thomas Grisham: Yeah. For example, using Lufthansa, because they have, let’s say a quarter of a million people working for them, something like that. Some of them are Lufthansa employees. Some of them are outsourced employees, temporary workers, consultants, things like that. And so you’re right, it’s this collage of assets that exist, and what I tell them and what I suggest to people who have such large organizations that are global, is to try and look at them as individual component pieces.

Thomas Grisham: So for example, for Lufthansa, they have Lufthansa Technik. They’re the guys that, you know, fix the airplanes and parts and food and all that kind of stuff. And they’re scattered in, oh, I don’t know, couple dozen countries, at least, something like that. And what I suggested to them was, just look at your organization, look at one piece of it first, and see if there’s a way that you can reduce the distance from the top to the bottom.

Thomas Grisham: Try to find, for example, let’s say you have level one as CEO, for example. Let’s say that you have at level 5, 20 people. Can you reduce that to 19? And the question then becomes, let’s put a new person in, that we hire specifically with a skillset that’s able to work in that kind of environment. They thrive in that kind of environment.

Thomas Grisham: And let’s do a test. Let’s give it six months and we’ll do metrics on it each time. So for example, it’s not difficult to do metrics on communications or knowledge. You have to set it up and you need the technology to support all this.

Take it a piece at a time

-–

Thomas Grisham: So my suggestion to them is, take it a bite at a time. You can’t just trash an organization that’s this size, you can’t rebuild it overnight.

Thomas Grisham: You have to take a piece of it and see if it will work for you as an organization. And honestly Bill, in some cases, it won’t work. In Japan, there are organizations that are Keiretsu, which are groups of organizations that have unwritten ties between themselves, where the communications are not only vertically within one organization, but they’re horizontally across organizations through this buddy system.

Thomas Grisham: The hierarchy is too strong, it is not changeable. Now, more generation, perhaps two, yes. And the people who are now coming into are now different kinds of mindsets than the people they’re replacing.

Thomas Grisham: And so having these conversations with a group of people who are trying to do this in practice, Bill. That’s exactly what I suggest to them is, don’t try and upend everything because you’ll just create more chaos, which is what you don’t need.

Thomas Grisham: But think about this over the next five years. We have 12 levels now in Lufthansa Technik. Let’s see if we can get to 10 over the next two years. Build a plan, set the metrics, keep going.

Thomas Grisham: And that’s the only rational way that I can suggest to you. There’s no right number because, if you have, for example, General Electric, 18 businesses, 130 countries,it’s going to take a lot of people. Yeah.

Thomas Grisham: And so the dilemma is, you can only just take a piece of it and work on the pieces that you think will give you the greatest amount of flexibility.

Thomas Grisham: So it needs to begin at the board level and come down, not begin at the grassroots and try and come up. That won’t work. I know, I’ve tried it, I’ve seen it. Doesn’t work.

Bill Raymond: I mean, I think I’ve seen some teams, some groups adopt agility and in whatever sense that means. Usually when someone says that, they mean a framework like SCRUM or SAFe, or they mean that they’ve adopted some practices that, you know, help them kind of communicate better.

Bill Raymond: And what I’ve seen very often is they feel better because they have some sort of a planning process, they call it sprint planning. They have you know, time that they set aside to get that work done, and then they have time that they set aside to really deliver on what they planned. And that seems to work out fairly well, and we see that happen in the software development and IT world, fairly well.

Bill Raymond: The problem is that the rest of the organization isn’t behind all of this. And then you end up with all these external factors that almost try to force you back into some other way of doing things.

The Mindset of a Leader

-–

Bill Raymond: So let’s think about that from the mindset elements that we’ve been talking about in this podcast, what would a leader that’s maybe shifting to agility, what is the mindset that a leader should have, so that they can kind of keep this open mind and think about new ways of structuring the organization and thinking about how teams might function, you know, more productively?

That’s a good question, and it’s a big one.

Yeah, to oversimplify this quite a bit, the thing that I have suggested to many people and has worked, because again, depending on whether the organization is an IT organization by nature, or it’s this conglomerate thing that’s got an IT component, but it does a lot of other things, will make a huge amount of difference.

Thomas Grisham: But if we just confine it to the IT for just a second and just think about that arena. If you had a company,the kind of person that you would want being, let’s say a mid-level leader, somebody who’s, maybe two steps, one step, two step removed from the CEO, something like that.

Empower those under you

Thomas Grisham: What you want to do, if you’re capable of it, what you want to do is you want to empower the people who are under you and adjacent to you to make their own decisions. That means that you’ve got to be responsible for their mistakes.

Thomas Grisham: The problem with leadership is, to be a leader, you have to be vulnerable. You have to expose yourself to risks for other people’s mistakes. People learn by making mistakes, they don’t learn by getting it right.

Thomas Grisham: And so think of it in that term. As a leader, you are in charge of mistakes. That’s really uncomfortable for a lot of people. And that’s the key. That is the absolute foundation for this, because there is no possible way that you can learn everything you need to know to work in this world today. It’s not possible.

Thomas Grisham: You’re going to make mistakes, whether you’re the board or whether you’re a person working, you know, writing code or factoring it or whatever else you do in the company, the key to it is to empower the people, to let them make their own decisions because you hired them as experts. Leave them alone and just support them.

Thomas Grisham: So if they call you and say, you know, I got too much going on, I can’t focus on all this. The answer is not, work more hours. The answer is, let me see if I can take some of that off of you. That means that you’re going to have to go find some more help, which means your budget’s going to go up, which means you’re going to get blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Thomas Grisham: And so the key to it is, you have to be comfortable in your own skin. Nietzsche said, if you’re not happy being alone, you’re a bad company. You need to be comfortable and solid in your knowledge of yourself. You can’t lead other people unless you know who you are. And so emotional intelligence, to use the academic term, maturity, to use a more common term, is fundamental in my mind.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, that, I think resonates with me as well. You know, I’ve gone through a number of organizational transformation projects. Some of them as an employee, some of them as even a consultant. And one of the interesting things that I always did find was that, as you know, you said you have to be comfortable with making mistakes and take accountability for that.

Bill Raymond: I do think that the more you shrink an organization and I think you used something along the lines of six levels or, you know, when it gets to that point, you can’t be an expert in everything anymore. You know, you do have to just trust that people are out there doing the work that they need to, and you’re just keeping a pulse on it.

Bill Raymond: And my experience with these types of things is that, as I think you were alluding to, you spend a lot of time thinking about how to alleviate the pressure on the team so that they can do more work. And that might mean hiring more staff. It might mean helping to change internal corporate processes. I can work with my other colleagues to maybe cut out some of that proverbial red tape for example, because I see the pain that my team’s experiencing.

Bill Raymond: And yes, people will make a mistake and yes, you need to take accountability for it. But I think the important thing here is that even as mistakes get made, you know, there’s a acceptance in the organization that we are putting trust in people where we don’t necessarily have direct everyday knowledge of everything that’s going on, and that we focus on fixing the problem, not focus on targeting the person.

Broaden your horizon

-–

Thomas Grisham: Yes. I agree with you a hundred percent. And as you can imagine, and everyone listening can imagine, if you have a company with 10,000 people and you did everything that I said, you know, at the beginning, you designed it before you hired anybody. Where are you going to find 10,000 people like that?

Bill Raymond: mm-hmm

Thomas Grisham: And so the dilemma what most companies that I’ve consulted with, what I’ve suggested to them is, you need to broaden your horizon. There are people working in Ghana today who have exactly the characteristics you want. The problem is they have been suppressed into a culture that causes them to think in ways that are not particularly useful. Can you adjust that?

Thomas Grisham: And so my suggestion to people is, look globally when you’re looking for these kind of assets. You’ll find them in every country. I promise you I’ve done it. You’ll find them everywhere, but the thing is, picking them is not quick. It is not easy. You need someone who has emotional intelligence and knows where you’re headed.

Thomas Grisham: And I don’t mean, okay, here’s the nature of a person, go out and find me a bunch of EQP.

Thomas Grisham: No. Here is a person who knows how the company works, understands the vision and the product and the customer, but happens to spend some of their day hiring people. That’s a completely different mindset, and it’s one that you have to build into the organization, as I said, from top, down.

Thomas Grisham: You can do the individual projects and stuff bottom-up, and companies will look at them and say, wow, hey, that’s really cool. I wonder if we can make that a global thing. And that’s where, you know, this interface that we’ve been talking about comes in. Because most companies go exactly that direction because it’s easier. Oh, I’ll get yours six IT guys, let me just stick them in a room, leave them alone, they’ll come out in two weeks and oh, we got something we can use.

Thomas Grisham: I will tell your audience one more thing. I did my first agile project in 1975. In 1975, we didn’t have computers yet, let alone cell phones. But it was exactly the same idea. Precisely, we didn’t call it agile, but it was precisely the same idea as IT agile, as you described it.

Thomas Grisham: We realized that if you want to get something done quickly, you have to make a direct connection between the person who needs something, call them a customer, and the person doing it.

Thomas Grisham: Number two, give them enough time to do it. I’d like you to sweep the house, clean up the garden, wash the car, do these four codes for these six projects, answer 200 emails, don’t sleep tonight and come in with a happy attitude tomorrow. Thanks very much.

So the dilemma, Bill, is that everybody knows what they need to do. This is not new. Every MBA student, PhD student I’ve taught over the last 20 years, they get all this. I’ve taught them and they walk in an organization and go, oh, oh, you didn’t tell me what I was supposed to do with it. How do I use this in an organization that’s hierarchical?

Thomas Grisham: And I agree with you. I think that the thing is you just look for the kind of talent that is comfortable walking in those shoes that we were describing, and you do them one at a time.

People need to show their value and be seen

-–

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I think that’s really good insight. And although sounds simple, it’s really not because you do have to think about that vision that you talked about, you have to think about the, you know, types of people that you value, the way in which they work. You have to make sure that there’s a space for them to be able to show their value, right?

They want to be seen, they want to progress in their career and then you have to make sure that, you know, that they’re all going to work in this way that you expect.

Bill Raymond: I can tell you from experience, and I think you’re saying, talking from experience as well with everything you’re saying here. But you know, I just remembered there are some organizations I worked in where we always would get together and talk to a potential new hire, and we’d find time for them and we’d share our culture. But then there’d always be this sort of one role or this one important kind of, someone sees it as strategic role, where no one gets involved. And one or two people make this decision without letting anyone else know, and then they bring this person in. And 100% of the time that person was not a cultural fit because they weren’t vetted by the people that they had to work with.

Thomas Grisham: Yes. I agree.

Thomas Grisham: Okay, let me just say this. Think about it this way, in really just simple terms. If you’re the chairman of the board of directors for a company, your job is to think strategically. You know, what’s coming? What kind of competition’s out there? What do we need to be doing five years from now? So you know, those kind of things.

Thomas Grisham: And in many companies that I’ve worked for, and I’m sure you as well, one of the values that everybody has hanging over their front door is, customer first. Oh, okay.

Thomas Grisham: And what I’m sure, you know, as well as I do is when you get down to level 12 or whatever it is, and you have an IT person working with a customer, and the IT person knows perfectly well that if they provide exactly what was in the contract, the customer will be wholly unhappy, and it will not be functional.

Thomas Grisham: So just think of that for a second. So you have a board of directors member who doesn’t know this person, and you have this person who doesn’t know anybody on the board of directors.

Thomas Grisham: What does this person do? Do they do what you told them to do as value and make the customer satisfied? Or do they do what you told them to do because of the contract, which is give them this much and then stop. And if you guessed wrong, we’re going to fire you. Think about that scenario. It’s a real simple one that happens every day around the planet.

Thomas Grisham: If you want to cut that cord in that system, who needs to do something? And that’s the answer to the question. It’s all of those people in that communication chain, because if the board of directors says, the slogan needs to be customer satisfaction first, but in fact, our values are, we need to make our numbers for quarter 1 in 2023.

Thomas Grisham: And the person at the bottom doesn’t know that’s the current plan. Everybody’s going to be off in different directions. That’s what creates some of the chaos in organizations. And as we had discussed, the fix for that is, it’s in the middle of that chain. That’s where it exists, and that’s where you need to focus.

Bill Raymond: Yeah that’s really good insight. I very much appreciate that.

Some takeaways to implement these changes

-–

Bill Raymond: As we’re wrapping up the podcast, if there’s any leaders listening to this podcast right now and they’re listening to the things that you have to say,what are maybe one or two things that they can walk away with and start doing right now, that doesn’t need a lot of training or reading up on,that could start to implement these changes?

There’s I would say, it would begin with just personal reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror, honestly. If you Google, emotional intelligence, there’s a ton of free metrics out there online that’ll give you kind of a clue of where you are. But the idea is I’d say, look in the mirror honestly first.

Thomas Grisham: And then one thing that helps would be just to keep yourself a simple diary for maybe a week or two, where if you’ve got five people working for you, ask them a couple of simple questions. You know, Monday morning, Bill, are you happy? And write down the response. And you know, if they’re not terrified of telling you the truth, deal with that first or walk over there.

Thomas Grisham: But if they’re willing to tell you the truth and say, you know, God, I need help here, man. I’m my family, blah, blah. But whatever the issue may be. Offer to help and write it down.

Thomas Grisham: And then a week from then after you’ve helped this one person, go back and ask the same question again. And ask yourself the same question again, by looking in the mirror. It’s a stupidly simple way to begin, but the essence of all this is really simple, you lead from behind.

Thomas Grisham: If you are the leader, your job is to support people and to remove barricades. Your job is not to tell them what to do or tell them how to do it. Millennials, all of the literature shows that’s exactly the wrong thing to do. So many, if not, most of the IT people out there wandering around the planet, it’s exactly the wrong thing to do.

Thomas Grisham: Tell them what you need, support them and get out of the way. Practice empowerment by doing it. It’s really not complicated. Give it a try. I’ve suggested this to a lot of people and it’s a good way to begin.

Bill Raymond: And thank you for that. I do appreciate it. You know, I know that I had this revelation sometime in, you know, I am a very hands-on person. I get excited about the details of work. And that doesn’t necessarily mean I want to be a micromanager. It means that I get excited about whatever it is, the technology, the advertising, whatever it is that I happen to be working on, I get so into it that I start engaging with the teams. And the teams know that I’m the senior person in the room. And so as I start throwing out ideas, people start looking at that as me telling them what to do.

Bill Raymond: And when I start asking questions to learn more because I’m excited about it, and I’m just, and I’m interested, people are saying, I’m spending too much time working with you and not actually getting the work done.

Bill Raymond: And so I’ve definitely had those look-in-the-mirror moments to say, why does my team seem unhappy? And there was a lot of times when they would say something along the lines of, you know, Bill, you know, you’re too involved. And I just did not get it, right? Because people want to be, if you will, politically correct and they will try not to come right at you and tell you what the problem is. They’ll use terms and you have to kind of figure out really what you’re doing.

Bill Raymond: And I remembered when I was hearing that my team wasn’t too happy with what I was doing, and I knew that I needed to change and I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. You know, I brought in a coach, and that coach sat in on a month’s worth of meetings, team meetings with me. They did not engage at all, they just listened. And then I got the feedback that told me that this is the problem.

Bill Raymond: And so I was able to step back and just say, okay, I’m doing actions that are reducing the capability of my team. And so sometimes that looking in the mirror can be hard without really know what people are thinking.

Bill Raymond: I like your diary idea as well, just kind of writing these things down. It gives you a self-inflection point. So I really appreciate that.

        <content>Today, I am excited to share a conversation with Christina Wodtke, a celebrity in agile leadership and team dynamics. Christina is the author of popular books like The Team that Managed Itself and Radical Focus.

Christina brings a wealth of agile knowledge in the agile space, having worked with tech companies like LinkedIn, Zynga, and Yahoo!, not to mention having founded three startups.

Christina is an executive leadership coach who teaches techniques to create high-performing teams at the prestigious Stanford University.

I am excited to share that Christina will share her new thoughts and ideas concerning nimble and stable teams.

In this conversation, you will hear Christina talk about the importance of Psychological Safety. If you are unfamiliar with the topic, I suggest you locate the podcast just before the one you are listening to now. It is titled Building a Culture of Psychological Safety and contains a fantastic conversation with Alla Weinberg as an introduction to the topic.

Christina will also talk frequently about OKRs – or objectives and key results. If you are unfamiliar with the topic, you can listen to my conversation with Christina’s friend and colleague, Jeff Gothelf. You can find that conversation in the Agile in Action podcast titled “Introducing Objectives and Key Results.”</content>

        <content>Today, Chris Jones, partner at Silicon Valley Product Group and co-author of the book Empowered joins us to talk about the shift to agility and a product-focused culture.

Chris shares how too many times, we focus on delivering a project that we assume has a beginning, middle, and end when we should look at it differently. Successful organizations treat such efforts as a product where there is not necessarily a planned end in mind. There are full-time product teams that are hyper-focused on delivering customer-focused solutions to problems.</content>
