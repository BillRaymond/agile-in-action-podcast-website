        <content>Business agility represents the continuous and purposeful change you make to deliver more value to your customers and gain a competitive edge. Very often, we use frameworks that guide how to be more agile.
 The list of frameworks is endless and full of acronyms, like SCRUM, XP, SaFe, and many more. It can be tempting to select a framework that looks good and start using it. However, there are downsides to that approach.

In today’s podcast, I speak with Evan Leybourn, Co-founder and CEO of the Business Agility Institute. We talk about why agility can increase revenues, improve team performance, and retain employees. Evan shares the approach you should take to define what agility means to your organization and balance that with the various frameworks available to you.

        <content>Leadership may define business goals, but how does your product strategy align? Enter the role of a Product Manager. Product Managers identify the strategic objectives and plans for a product and ensure they align closely with leadership’s business goals. Today, I speak to Albert Chen, a Senior Product Manager at Okta and an organizer at the San Francisco chapter of ProductTank. Albert shares his view of the role of a Product Manager, where they belong in the corporate structure, the deliverables they produce, and how they are going about defining markets.

        <content>In today’s Agile in Action podcast, I speak with Jose Levy, Director of Cloud Services at OnePlan. We discuss the importance portfolio management processes and software still play in today’s modern organization.

In this podcast, he explains that as organizations embrace agile, leaders must recognize that not every project will use agile techniques. Further, not all teams will use the same applications to manage those projects. Different teams and functions in an organization can coexist on the agile spectrum while working towards a common objective.

        <title>A day in the life of a SCRUM Master with Michele Magnardini at Sage</title>

        <content>When you think about agile teams, or more specifically, Scrum teams, you will often hear about a role called the Scrum Master. That role is frequently confused, and you will often hear the position referred to as a project manager with a new and modern title.

For some, agile is a brand-new way to work, and therefore a brand new way of structuring your organization. Any organizational change requires new or changed roles, adjusting to a new culture, and shifting focus. That change is never-ending because customer needs, products, and technology will not stop changing our business landscape.

In today’s podcast, I speak with Michele Magnardini, Scrum Master at Sage. He talks about the role of a Scrum Master, which helps improve team dynamics and plays a critical role in continuous team improvements. If your organization is considering adopting agile, you likely came across the term Scrum. Agile and Scrum can represent a tectonic shift in how companies work and structure teams. Embracing this change is not a one-and-done project but an entirely new way of working, which means change will be continuous, with regular improvements in support of teams to deliver customer value.

In today’s fun and lively conversation Michele makes no assumptions that you are a Scrum expert, walking you through all the basics. You will learn how Scrum works, including the roles, meetings, and artifacts defined by the framework. Then, he shares the critical role of a Scrum Master.

Sadly, many consider the Scrum Master as a project manager with a new, modern title. That cannot be farther from the truth, and you will learn just how important the Scrum Master’s role is to that continuous improvement process I share earlier in this post.
