        <content>Today, Chris Jones, partner at Silicon Valley Product Group and co-author of the book Empowered joins us to talk about the shift to agility and a product-focused culture.

Chris shares how too many times, we focus on delivering a project that we assume has a beginning, middle, and end when we should look at it differently. Successful organizations treat such efforts as a product where there is not necessarily a planned end in mind. There are full-time product teams that are hyper-focused on delivering customer-focused solutions to problems.</content>

        <content>In today’s podcast, I speak with Glenn Gow, The CEO Therapist and a CEO Coach. If your organization is unclear about its intended objectives, you will not achieve alignment. That misalignment can have tangible costs, such as not meeting revenue targets, reduced customer value, or reduced employee satisfaction. Glenn shares how CEOs and senior leaders should define measurable Objectives and Key Results. Glenn also shares how to align the organization to those OKRs and ensure accountability.</content>

        <content>Laura Pirro came to learn some agile concepts taking a course while at Ghent University. The course teacher said agile is primarily for software development and did not apply to R&amp;D. Laura decided to learn more about agile and found that R&amp;D projects could benefit from the ideas.

Without using the word “agile,” Laura started implementing some of the modern ideas brought to us by organizations like Scrum.org. Laura introduced regular, shorter meetings with the leads on projects (also called standup meetings). Laura also started developing smaller pieces of the overall R&amp;D work with her colleagues by writing smaller, manageable elements of the comprehensive paper and then iterating on that (also called MVPs, or minimum viable products).

Now working for Yara International, Laura shares insights and real-world examples that may inspire you as a student or working in the private sector.</content>

Blake Bassett defines an operating model and then shares how you can consider creating your own. Blake shares how to consider building a model by using the following topic areas:

1. Goals and measures of success

2. Team principles

3. Development process

4. Workflow

5. Activities

6. Decision-making
