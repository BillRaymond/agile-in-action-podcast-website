        <content>SCRUM is a recipe, not a guarantee of success. Today, Fred Fowler shares that the focus on accountability and value-driven assessments drives any successful SCRUM implementation. In Today’s podcast, Fred will focus on topics like:

✅ Individual accountability

✅ Value-driven investment decisions

✅ Iterative product design

✅ Product Ownership

Transcript

(transcripts are auto-generated, so please excuse the brevity)
Fred Fowler: The worst thing in the world is for people to make decisions but not be accountable for the results. If you assign somebody to be a product owner and they want to do something and you overrule them, guess what? Now you are accountable for the results, not them.

Bill Raymond: Hi, this is Bill Raymond. If you are a regular listener of this podcast, you know we put all our energy into delivering content that you, our listeners want to hear.

Bill Raymond: One topic that comes up regularly in the Agile in Action podcast is a framework we call SCRUM. And you’ve asked to learn more about That is why over the coming fall, 2022 and winter 2023 months, I will be interviewing accomplished leaders in the SCRUM space to teach you about the framework. If you are new to the scrum framework or deeply familiar, I hope you will learn something important in your ever-changing journey towards organizational agility and value driven delivery.

Bill Raymond: So with that, let’s get started.

Introductions

Bill Raymond: Hi, and welcome to the podcast. Today, I’m joined by Fred Fowler, founder and CEO of Silicon Valley SCRUM, bestselling author on SCRUM, professional SCRUM master level three, which I’m interested in learning about, and a SCRUM advisor. Hi Fred, how are you today?

Fred Fowler: Hello. I’m great, how are you today?

Bill Raymond: I’m doing great as well. Thank you for joining today.

Today’s Topic

Bill Raymond: We’re going to talk about what makes SCRUM work when it’s done correctly, but before we do that, could you introduce yourself, share a little bit about yourself and also, I’d love it if you share what this professional SCRUM master level three is.

Fred Fowler: Okay. Alright. Well, I’ve been working in Silicon valley for forever. I wrote my first professional code in 1980, and so I followed the growth of Silicon Valley and also the growth of software development techniques and methods and frameworks ever since then. I first got introduced to SCRUM back in 2006. I should say I first got formally introduced, because when I discovered it, I realized I’d been using those methods and those ideas for a long time, because they kind of make sense.

Fred Fowler: So anyway, my first professional SCRUM work was way back then. Since then, I’ve progressed. I was the CIO of a distribution company in Silicon Valley with 21 locations around North America.

I introduced SCRUM there, it was very successful. I got more and more into it, and then finally, I decided to make SCRUM my career, my vocation. So I studied, got my level three certification early on, and I’ve been writing about it and teaching about it, instructing people ever since.

Certification based on merit

Fred Fowler: Now, by the way, I’ve got a certification through an organization called SCRUM.org. It was founded by Ken Schwaber, who was one of the co-creators of the SCRUM guide, along with Jeff Sutherland. And hedecided to certify people based on merit. In order to get a certification, you have pass some rigorous examinations.

SCRUM certification levels

Fred Fowler: The level one, PSM level one, is quite difficult, and it really is designed to indicate whether you know the SCRUM framework, whether you have read the SCRUM guide and understand it.

Fred Fowler: Now, PSM level two is a step above that, because level two tests to see whether you know how to put SCRUM into practice. Do you have the ability to take a situation, understand it vis-a-vis the SCRUM framework, and then figure out how to proceed along SCRUM lines.

Fred Fowler: Now, level three, which is the most difficult of all, basically, it’s a two-hour examination with nothing but essay questions.

Fred Fowler: And the purpose of level three is to determine whether you understand SCRUM well enough to be able to teach it to others. It’s very rigorous, it’s expensive to take the test, so only a handful of people worldwide have ever achieved professional SCRUM level three. And I’m proud to say that I’m one of them, and I’ve been one since, I think 2015 is when I passed. So a long time.

Bill Raymond: Well, congratulations. And I’m glad to have you on here to talk about SCRUM, because we’re going to get into this from a, if you will, maybe a bit more of an executive perspective.

Bill Raymond: Anytime someone says the word Agile, usually the word SCRUM or SAFe comes up. Where did SCRUM come from and what kind of problems is it trying to solve?

The old model of building software wasn’t working

Fred Fowler: Okay. Okay. Sure, sure.

Fred Fowler: Yeah, there was a great ferment, if you will, back in the early 1990s about software development basically saying, you know, what what’s going on here, this just isn’t working? The old model was kind of the same kind of model as an assembly line in a factory.

Fred Fowler: The idea was, well, you have different kind of tasks that have to be done to create some software products.

Fred Fowler: So you do the classic division of labor, you have some people do this task, which prepares the product for the next step, which some people do other tasks and the next step and the next step and the next step until finally, you get to the end. And it wasn’t working.

Fred Fowler: There’s a famous author, is named, oh my Roman Pilcher, Roman Pilcher. He wrote a book, "Agile Product Management with SCRUM." He talked about his experience as a project manager of a very ambitious project. Basically, it was a medical services company who wanted to replatform their entire product, bring it up to date. And it was a two-year project. There were nine different paths, which he managed very effectively, brought it in on time and on budget after two years, only to discover that they had created the perfect product for two years ago and the market had moved on and all of that time and effort was a complete write-off.

And that’s not an uncommon story. There are plenty of stories like that. And so the people who came up with SCRUM and also the people who came up with the Agile Manifesto were saying, you know, this stuff isn’t working. What would work? What are we trying to figure out?

Fred Fowler: And in 1995, a long time ago, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland presented the SCRUM framework in its initial form at a conference called OOPS, Object Oriented Program, forget what the other one was.

The Agile Manifesto

Fred Fowler: And then a few years later, six years later, in 2001, Schwaber and Sutherland, and a bunch of other people came back. Martin Fowler, a bunch of folks got together at a Snowbird ski resort for a long weekend. And said, what are we discovering here? What’s going on here, what’s really happening?

Fred Fowler: And they came up with the Agile Manifesto, which is a set of 4 values and 12 principles. And they were basically saying, well, we figured these out because we’ve been doing software and we’ve been helping others do it, and we find that these principles are kind of behind success. And then the SCRUM framework was kind of a recipe for implementing these values and principles and some other ideas.

Everybody’s Focused on the Recipe

Fred Fowler: Now unfortunately, everybody’s focused on the recipe. When you talk to SCRUM people, they talk, well, you have to have this 15-minute daily meeting. You have to have this, you have to have that, cause that’s what the SCRUM guide says. They’re missing the point. The recipe isn’t important. What’s behind the recipe is important. And there’s some very key insights behind all of that, which really make it work. And if you try to follow the recipe without understanding those insights, you’re probably going to fail, because you’re just going to be going through the motions without really understanding what makes it work. And the things that make it work, will make it work, whether you use the SCRUM framework strictly or not.

Fred Fowler: So ever since I wrote my first book, I kind of got on the idea that the world needed to know what makes it work, not how it works. And so, I’ve been talking about that ever since.

Bill Raymond: I really appreciate that overview and I think it’s interesting when we talk about project management, the way you were talking about it in the 1990s, I remembered, I mean, I was in the industry. I’m still in the project management industry for sure, and I’m still in this Agile space, but I remembered, when I was a consultant doing a lot of assessments.

Bill Raymond: You know, one of the biggest problems that we noticed that teams were having was that they didn’t do enough planning. And that’s what we put all of our effort into, was getting people to do more planning and write that scope statement upfront and create some sort of a detailed flow of work and assign the people.

Bill Raymond: And that’s that sort of two-year, but two-year lost effort that came in on time, on budget, but was, too little too late. And I think what the way SCRUM kind of turns us around, and agility in general turns us around, is to say, yes, there does need to be some sort of a plan. You do need to have some sort of a vision, but let’s also not wrap up everything into some perfect package that it will never be, and start delivering more frequently.

Adapting to an Ever-changing World

Fred Fowler: Yeah, absolutely. The world is full of examples of successful products that didn’t start out as what they ended up being. That’s kind of the essence of what those people at Snowbird were saying. They’re saying, we can make a perfect plan, but the world is always changing. And so what we need to do, is we need to watch that change happen and adapt to it, so we don’t end up creating the perfect product for some time in the past, rather than here and now.

What You Intend and What You Want

Fred Fowler: If I recall correctly, WebEx, very famous product for conferencing and stuff like that, didn’t start out as that. It started out as a way for tech support people to get into a customer’s PC and operate it, with the customer adding the password, so it was all safe and secure. So it was actually a support tool, which somebody said, Hey, well, wait a second, if we can do this, then we can let other people, and it turned into what WebEx is now.

Fred Fowler: So the realization there is that what you intend isn’t necessarily what you want, and you don’t really know what you want. You have to discover it as you go.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, customer expectations andnew markets can change the direction so quickly. And if everyone just has their heels dug into some sort of a far off plan, then you missed a huge opportunity.

Every Product is About Solving a Problem

Bill Raymond: Huh? Yeah. It’s all about problem-solving. Every product is a solution to some customer’s problems. And that’s one thing that the SCRUM framework and Agile, all that, are now focusing on. They’re focusing on the fact that this is all about solving problems. And the problems change, they mutate over time.

Fred Fowler: So you need an approach that will let you, in effect, do experiments. Try something, see what works, see what the customers are interested in. You might think that you’ve got three features, the customer really liked feature number one. And then the third feature is something you kind of threw in just because it was easy. And then it turns out the customer loves that third feature. They don’t care about the other two. So what you have to do is, you have to have a mechanism that will let you learn that as you go and adjust as you go.

Discovering the Product You Have to Create

Fred Fowler: So that’s why the SCRUM framework is all about iteration. You try something, you bounce it off the customer, see what the customer says, learn from that, adjust your plan, and then move forward on a step by step basis. In effect, you discover the product that you have to create rather than envision it and plan it.

The different kinds of problems

Fred Fowler: By the way, you did mention something I forgot to talk about, and that is the different kinds of problems there are, and how each kind of problem has its own approach for addressing it. There’s some academic work that’s been done that basically divides the world of problems into four groups.

Fred Fowler: The first group, it’s a simple problem. It’s not very complicated, there’s not what you don’t know, and there’s a no brainer. So you don’t really need a structure to solve that.

Fred Fowler: The next kind of problem is a complicated problem. A complicated problem might have lots of moving parts, might be very intricate, but in the end, you know everything you need to know to solve it right upfront. And that kind of problem, if you know everything you need to know, well, then the PMI approach, the waterfall approach makes sense. If you know everything you need to know, you can make a rationalized plan that optimizes your resources, delivers on time. Since everything is known, you can optimize it that way.

Fred Fowler: And an example of that would be, I like to talk about the example of building houses. Let’s say that you’re a developer and you’ve bought a plot of land, you want to put a hundred houses on it. By the time you’ve built house number 99, there’s no mystery about building number 100. You know how much board-feet of lumber you need, you know how many carpenters, you know how many plumbers, you know everything because you’ve done it 99 times already. You have accumulated experience doing it. So it makes sense to plan it, you have everything you need to do to plan it.

Fred Fowler: Now contrast that with building house number 1. You don’t really know anything about it. You have some guesses, but when you build house number 1, then you find out, whoops, we made a mistake. Theupstairs toilet is right over the dining room. So when people are having their beautiful formal dinner, a toilet flushing above. Oh, we can’t do that. And oh, the span of that beam over the living room holding up the second floor is too big. We’re going to need a huge, big timber to hold that up. We have to change that.

Fred Fowler: So the first house is a problem-solving exercise. So as you can accumulate enough experience in order to create project plans, good old PMI project plans to build the rest of them, because all the mysteries have been uncovered.

Fred Fowler: And that’s what SCRUM is designed to do. SCRUM is an organized process of discovery. It allows you in effect, to build that first house and make mistakes, but learn from them and ultimately, find your way through. Discover how to build that first house, and then you know how to do it again. Now, software is a kind of interesting product because you never accumulate experience building the same software product over and over again. always building software for the first time. And if you try to build it based on a huge, big planning effort ahead of time, well, nobody’s perfect. And you’re going to find all the mistakes you made in that plan as you go.

Fred Fowler: And then the question is, well, what do you do about those mistakes? And in a typical waterfall environment, you have a rigid project plan with deadlines, deliverables, the plan can’t change because you’re just going to blast off by all kinds of people at all kinds of levels.

Fred Fowler: And there’s probably some changeacceptance board or change control board, where you have to go and petition them to allow you to make a change, if you discover you made a mistake.

Fred Fowler: And SCRUM is the opposite of that. Every time you do a sprint, which is a particular period of time, you have a chance to evaluate what happened, look at the marketplace and make adjustments. So you go in with the presumption that you don’t really know how to create what you want. You have some idea of what you want, but that can change. So you go through a step by step process where in effect you discover the product that the customer wants and you discover how to build it.

Fred Fowler: And by the way, that SCRUM type of problem is called a complex problem. A complex problem is one where you don’t know everything ahead of time, and you have to discover the way to do it.

Bill Raymond: You want to make sure that you are adjusting for the market. You’re making sure you’re validating your work against what the customer needs are. You can shift quickly, you can modify what you’re doing quickly in order to address those needs.

Bill Raymond: You’re focusing on the problem. So someone might say, we’ll put a button here, but the problem is that they need to be able to print something. And so you can resolve that a different way. But the idea here is that you’re constantlyiterating on these things.

Bill Raymond: And that makes sense the types of work that you talked about, where maybe if you will, if a more traditional project management kind of approach versus a more SCRUM-style approach makes sense.

And so I can definitely understand that. But one of the things that I think is a challenge sometimes to get over, and I’m interested in hearing your thoughts on this, especially for leaders that are now starting to think, this is something that everyone on my team is talking about and I want to make this work.

Implementing SCRUM in Your Organization

Bill Raymond: So what are some of the things that you need to think about if you want to implement SCRUM and make it work in your organization? I know that this is a fairly open-ended question, so maybe we can tackle a few of them,one at a time, like, for example, maybe you can talk a little bit about the roles first.

Fred Fowler: Okay. Yes. Yes. And actually, that’s exactly what I was going to talk about when you started your question, because what does a person in management need to understand in order for this to work? OK. And it turns out it’s kind of straightforward.

Two Kinds of Product Development Questions

Fred Fowler: There are always two kinds of questions to answer in any product development.

Fred Fowler: **The first question is, what should we develop? The other question is, how should we develop it? What do we do? How do we do it? **

Fred Fowler: And the SCRUM framework divides those questions into two groups and assigns people to answer them. One of the great powers of the SCRUM framework is that associates authority, capability, and accountability. Now the people who make decisions, who are authorized to make those decisions are first of all, they’re capable, and second of all, they’re accountable.

Fred Fowler: You know, you make a decision about what to create. Well, that is a business decision. It has to do with the customers that the company has, what they’re looking for. They’re all about decisions, about how to allocate our resources, to fill customer’s needs. In other words, these are investment decisions. The decisions about how to invest the time and effort of our developers in order to create value for the customers.

Fred Fowler: And those investment decisions are pretty significant. And if you make the wrong decision, well, that’s kind of really bad. So you want those decisions to be made by people who understand the business, understand the customers, and have the authority to invest tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in creating valuable solutions.

The Product Owner

Fred Fowler: In the SCRUM framework,the name of the role that does that is somebody called the Product Owner.

Fred Fowler: And the product owner is a business person who is fully empowered to set the agenda that the developers work towards. They identify all the problems that need to be solved, and they prioritize those problems. These are the most important ones right now, these are less important, but basically these are the challenges the developers need to address.

Value-based Investment Decisions

Fred Fowler: And again, these are investment decisions. If you’re spending $50,000 on a two-week sprint, $50,000 worth of developer time, you better get more than $50,000 worth of value out of that effort. And so one of the most important things that management needs to understand is that it’s all about value, and their role is to make value-based investment decisions and measure the results. Measure the value that is produced.

Fred Fowler: If there was one thing I could wave a magic wand and make everybody do in the business world, is to learn how to measure the value of their efforts. Lots and lots and lots of people don’t measure value at all. They measure activity. How busy are you? How busy are your people?

Fred Fowler: ** It’s very easy to measure how active people are. It’s not easy to measure how valuable their work product is. But you have to measure how valuable work product is if you want to try to optimize it**.

Value Example

Bill Raymond: Can you just give a simple example as to what you mean by being able to measure the value, do you have like a real world example to tie that together?

Fred Fowler: Oh, sure. You have a team and they created an app called, Goofy Bird or something and put it on the app store, and it downloads a million times at $1.99 a piece. So what’s the value of that Goofy Bird app? 1.99 million dollars. Okay. So, okay, great. If you spent $500,000 creating that app and it’s worth 1.99 million, is that a good deal?

Fred Fowler: Absolutely. Yeah, it was great. You got four times a return on your investment. That’s wonderful. Anybody would be happy with that.

Fred Fowler: Now let’s say that you spent 3 million dollars producing that 1.9 million Goofy Bird app. Was that a investment? Hell no. That’s a good way to get fired.

Measuring Value

Fred Fowler: Well, let’s talk about measuring value. There are actually four ways to increase value. By the way, value always needs to be measured in dollars and cents. You say, well, why? This is because you’re spending dollars and cents to create it. The way you measure the effectiveness of a product owner is on the return on the investment the product owner earns.

Fred Fowler: Now there are four ways.

Increase Revenue

Fred Fowler: One is increasing revenue. That’s our Goofy Bird example. You start with nothing, you got 1.99 million. That’s an increase in revenue.

Decrease Cost

Fred Fowler: Another way to get value is to decrease cost. If you sell a million widgets per year and you can make an improvement that reduces the cost of those widgets by 50 cents each, well, that improvement is worth 500 k. Simple as that.

Decrease Risk

Fred Fowler: Now the third way you can get value is by decreasing risk. So let’s say you have a problem that hits you maybe once a year, and every time it does, it costs a million dollars. Well then, solving that problem is worth a million dollars a year. By the way, I actually had that very same situation when I was the CIO of that distribution company.

We had our data center a long way away from the main internet hub. And there was a single fiber optic cable that connected our data center to that hub and then out to the rest of the world. And once a year, some idiot with a backhoe would dig up the dumb fiber optic cable and cut us off for a day.

Fred Fowler: And every day that we were cut off cost us a million dollars in revenue. So I ended up spending about $50,000 moving the data center to a secure location outside of Sacramento, huge big complex, where the likes of Google and Facebook and all those folks have their computers. It was a co-location facility, and we never had a problem again. So, did it make sense to spend $50,000 to solve a million dollar year problem? Of course it did.

Increase the Probability of Success

Fred Fowler: Now the last way you can increase revenue is by increasing the probability of success. Let’s say you’re in a bidding situation and one time out of six, you win the bid. But you make some improvement that increases your odds to two times out of six. That’s very valuable and it’s quantifiably valuable.

Fred Fowler: So you can then compare that to the cost of making that improvement in order to figure out value. You know, the problem is that, so many companies really, at least in the world of IT and software development, they don’t even think about value. They think about how do we reduce the cost? How do we meet the deadlines? How do we come in under budget? All of those things, because they’re all easy to measure. But what they should be saying is how much value are we producing and how much are we realizing? And the only way to measure that is to work with a customer.

Fred Fowler: That’s why LEAN focuses on minimum viable products. They want to get something into the hands of the customer so they can get feedback about what’s valuable about it.

Fred Fowler: So to really go in the Agile direction, a company needs to stop focusing on cost and deadline stuff and start focusing on figuring out how to measure the value of the work they’re doing. That’s the number one recommendation I would always make to people.

Strategic Advantages of SCRUM

Bill Raymond: I think for the rest of the time on this podcast, what I’d like to skip to, if you’re okay with this, is that we start talking about what are some of the strategic advantages of using SCRUM in an organization? What makes this work and what are the strategic advantages of it?

Fred Fowler: Oh, the strategic advantages. It’s focusing on solving problems that are actually valuable to solve. By the way, the product owner is responsible for figuring out what problems to solve. The developers are responsible for figuring out how to solve them.

Characteristics of Developers

Fred Fowler: And so the developers, they need to have two important characteristics, and they’re kind of strange words, but they need to be cross-functional and need to be self-organized.

Fred Fowler: Now, what does cross-functional mean? Well, it means that they need to be able to create the product. They need to have all the talents and skills, cover all the technical bases that are necessary in order to deliver a working product to the customer. They must be able to do that without any outside help.

Fred Fowler: Now you should ask, well, why? Why do they have to do that? Can’t we divide them up into groups the way it’s traditional?

No Pointing Fingers

Fred Fowler: The answer is that if you divide people into traditional sequence groups, then they always have fingers that can point at somebody else. Oh, the coders did a bad job, and so that’s why the testers are not able to get the stuff done because we have all these blockers so we have to kick it back to the coders.

Fred Fowler: If the coders and the testers are all part of the same team, there is no way they can point any fingers at anybody else. It’s very important for the teams to be capable of creating the product so they can accept accountability for doing so.

Fred Fowler: Not only that, but they have to manage themselves, which means they have to make their own decisions about how to create the product. Why is that? Well, because if somebody else tells them what to do, then they could just point fingers at that person saying, well, we did what we were told, but it didn’t work. Well, that’s their fault, not my fault.

The Team Makes its Own Decisions

Fred Fowler: The team has to make its own decisions so that it has to accept responsibility for its results. So there’s a kind of a partnership. The product owner says, this is what’s really valuable. And I’m accountable for saying that this is the most important stuff to do. And the developers say, okay, well if that’s very valuable, then, yeah, we can do it, but we have to do it this way. And the product manager says, okay, fine. For the next two weeks, you guys do your work, and then at the end of that two weeks, we’ll see what you’re able to do. And then we will look again at what’s going on and then make plans for the next two weeks.

Fred Fowler: Nobody has some roadmap that says, the deadline for this is this. So you have to make it no matter what.

Fred Fowler: **The developers have to be able to say no, so that when they say yes, it actually means something. And as developers can make their own decisions and are capable of building the product, because they have the right people on the team, then when they say yes, they don’t have an excuse for not doing it. Not only that, but they are saying yes to something that they believe they can do. **

Allow Developers to Make Their Own Decisions

And by the way, the role of management is critical. They have to allow developers to make their own decisions. But then they have to hold the developers accountable for the decisions they make. And by the way, it’s very uncommon for developers to be in this situation, because most developers just learn, okay, just tell me what you want me to do and I’ll do my best. What’s the plan? What’s my objective? What am I assigned? And I’ll do the best I can.

Fred Fowler: The trouble is, if it’s somebody else’s plan well, if they gave it to you to do and you couldn’t do that, that’s not my fault, that’s their fault. They assigned me something I couldn’t do. They were the boss, they should have known that.

Fred Fowler: And second of all, when I say I’ll do my best, well, nobody can measure whether I’m doing my best or not. So what they’re basically saying is sure, I’ll give it a try, but I don’t guarantee success. I’ll figure out to blame somebody else if doesn’t work.

Fred Fowler: So that’s why, if the developers make their own commitments, then they basically don’t have any excuse. And management needs to allow developers to make their own commitments.

Fred Fowler: By the way, there’s a role in there called the "SCRUM master." The SCRUM Master’s job is to teach the developers how to organize themselves. And if the developers don’t know how to organize themselves, it’ll just all fall flat. That’s why SCRUM Masters are very important.

Product Owners and Resource Allocation

Fred Fowler: By the way,the role of product owner needs support from upper management, because the product owner usually is involved with just one product. And the product owner of course, wants all the resources in the world to be devoted to their product, but somebody with higher responsibility than the product owner needs to make resource allocation decisions amongst other products competing for resources.

Fred Fowler: So let’s say you have one product that’s part of a family of products, sometimes called "a program." There needs to be somebody at the program level who can make decisions, resource allocation decisions, in other words, investment decisions, as to which products to back more strongly or which to back less strongly.

Fred Fowler: And again, that person can be evaluated based on the return on those investments. Did they actually result in a program of products that made a good return on those investments? And then at even a higher level, portfolio level, it’s the same thing. Program people are competing for resources. There might need to be somebody at a portfolio level, very high level, making basic resource allocation decisions amongst these different programs, or in other words, investments.

Bill Raymond: I get a lot of messages from people that are listening to the podcast. And the question that I get a lot is, you said that the product owner is from the business or part of the business, understands the business really well.

Bill Raymond: Does that mean that there’s a separation of the Agile team, the SCRUM team, meaning like the developers and other folks that are on the team are not communicating with the customer?

Fred Fowler: Well, if you have a business person who understands the business and the business person is writing up details, specifications for the developers to follow, would you expect those specifications to be very good or very accurate?

Bill Raymond: No.

Fred Fowler: Yeah. They’re outside of the skillset of the business owner, business person. Right. By the way, I’ve seen lots and lots and lots of examples of business people who try to write detailed specifications for developers to follow, and end up creating very bad technological solutions, because they don’t understand the technology very well. You should let the developers, the people who understand the technology, make those decisions, because they’re the ones who got the skills and the talent to do it.

Fred Fowler: Now likewise, do you want the developers talking with the client and figuring out what the client wants? Well, the developers can probably come up with all kinds of solutions to whatever the client wants. The question is, is the client willing to pay the cost of doing that? The developers aren’t really business people. They’re not really equipped to make those decisions.

Fred Fowler: So it’s a good idea for the developers to understand what the client wants, but it’s very important for the product owner to say, yeah, that’s what the client wants, but we can’t afford to do that for them.

Bill Raymond: And you say that it’s the product owner who’s also there to help prioritize as well. So what you’re saying is the developers, the SCRUM team, the people that are working on the project, they absolutely will be communicating with the customer, but it’s the product owner who’s setting the priorities and defining the large problems that have been solved.

Fred Fowler: Yes. Yes. By the way, there is an event in the SCRUM framework called "the sprint review," which is all about putting customers and developers and the product owner in the same room, talking about the product. And so the sprint view is where the product owner demonstrates what the product does now, after the work or the prior sprint.

Fred Fowler: And the purpose of that is to stimulate ideas about what it could do next. I wrote a book about SCRUM framework and I described a sprint review for a, situation that I was involved in. I was teaching people at that time and putting my students through the practice of using SCRUM to develop software for not-for-profit organizations. And there was one foundation, I forgot the name of it, but basically they had a big estate near Silicon Valley. It was out in the woods, you know, bucolic, beautiful, andthey held summer camps for kids with cancer. That was their charity.

Fred Fowler: And there was a big garden because it was an old winery and the people who, you know, grew the grapes, they loved plants. And so they had a very extensive, exotic garden. And the software project had to do with the fact that when the kids were there, they loved, they ran around the guarden and looked at all this thing, and then they asked the counselors, Hey, what’s that? What’s that? What’s that? And of course, these camp counselors were just college kids, you know, during the summer, and they weren’t botanists, they didn’t know.

The foundation had been given a bunch of iPads as a donation. And so the project was to use the iPad to help the counselors answer the questions about what’s that, what’s that, what’s that. And so the plan was to label each of the plants with a barcode and then use the iPad camera to read the barcode and then have it display information about the plant.

Fred Fowler: And so after the first sprint, we had a review with the foundation people, the product manager and the developers, and the developers hadn’t been able to print the barcodes yet, but they were able to display a barcode projected on a wall and then they hit it with the iPad camera and lo and behold, up came a page of information about the plant, after just two weeks.

Fred Fowler: And the foundation people were just blown away. Wow. That’s so cool. That’s great, wow, look and there’s picture of the plant and um um, can we we have more than one picture? Uhhuh? Well, we want the kid to be able to look at the plant and look at the picture and say, yep, that’s the same thing, but plants look different in the spring than they do in the fall, and in the winter and the.

Fred Fowler: And then the developer says, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah. Yes, yes, yes. You want a carousel. And by the way, the iPad knows what the date is, so we can figure out whether it’s spring or summer, so we can show the spring picture in the springtime, the summer picture in the summertime. And the foundation people says, you can do that? Man, that’s so cool. Wow.

Fred Fowler: And then the product owner wrote down in his notes, carousel of pictures, date-sensitive. That became a feature to be developed later. And then one of the developers popped up, by the way, would you like this thing to talk? What? Well, we could put a button on this screen, you press the button, it says talk, and it will read the screen out loud. The foundation people says, it can do that? Sure. Easy. This is Apple. This is iOS, you can do that. Wow. You mean, we can give this to kids who are too young to read? We can give this to kids who can’t see? Yeah. Wow. And then the product owner wrote down, text-to-speech button.

Fred Fowler: So that’s the kind of interaction that should happen. The developers and the customer could talk about what’s possible, but then the product owner has the final say over whether it’s going to get done or not. So that’s one of the sprint events, the sprint review, which is all about bringing everybody together and getting ideas for the product owner to prioritize for the next time around. Did that make sense?

Developers Got Separated from the Customer

Bill Raymond: That’s a great example. During this whole period where we were doing this top-down project management, having subject matter experts, write up the scope of the project and other subject matter experts writing up the statement of work and the work that needed to be done and the functional specs and the technical specs, the developers kind of just got handed things and they never got a chance to see the customer and meet the customer and understand their needs.

Bill Raymond: And I think sometimes we think about developers as that person that sort of just sits there and writes code and doesn’t want to be interrupted, but they do want to be interrupted when they get to get customer feedback. And that is absolutely one of the things that I think has changed dramatically as people start implementing this.

Bill Raymond: I think that’s one of the greatest values that a framework like SCRUM, or just this concept of agility with small teams working with a portion of the business to get work done. I think there’s a lot of value coming out of that, and that’s why we’re starting to see so much more innovation right now than we ever have.

Fred Fowler: Yes, absolutely. Yeah. Developers want to use their talents to help people, to solve problems, to be the hero. And you can’t be a hero if you’re working on something that some subject matter expert handled to you saying, do this. All you can do is just either do it or not do it, and there’s no sense of accomplishment there.

Fred Fowler: So, again, SCRUM and Agile, all focus on problem-solving. And different people bring different points of view, different aspects to that problem solving. And in the end, the problem’s solved and everybody can be proud of that. Unfortunately, you don’t want business people making technical decisions. You don’t want technical people making business decisions, but there just seems to be a tendency to do that. And perhaps people aren’t realizing that’s what’s happening, but because if they realize that, they kind of say, this is terrible, this is crazy, it’s backwards. You want technical people to show what’s possible. You want business people to say what’s desirable, and together they figure out what to do.

For Leaders, Before SCRUM Implementation

Bill Raymond: We’re getting close to the end of the podcast here, but let’s say that I am a senior leader in an organization, director, and I’m thinking about implementing SCRUM. Maybe I and some of my colleagues are looking at it. Certainly you can go to SCRUM.org and see it. It all looks fairly easy actually. But you know, maybe they’re not organized in such a way where you could properly implement everything that we just talked about right now. And so there needs to be some sort of a way to think about getting there. What are some things that a leader needs to think about before they jump into an implementation process?

Fred Fowler: Okay, well, if you’re just going to take the SCRUM guide and tell people, use this, it will fail, because the SCRUM guide is a recipe, but the recipe only works under the right conditions. The conditions are what are important.

Fred Fowler: And so as a leader, what I would say, I need to identify somebody who can be accountable for the value of product, who has the capability of making the decisions, the authority to make the decisions, and is willing to be accountable for the results of those decisions. And then put them in charge of whatever product you’re working on, and then back them up so that nobody can second-guess them, protect them.

Fred Fowler: By the way, the best product manager I ever had was the COO of an organization. It was best because he understood the business, he knew what he wanted and nobody could second-guess him.

Fred Fowler: So that’s the kind of product owner you want to have. And then you get the product owner to talk about what is desirable, what the problems to solve are. And then attract a nucleus of technical people around that product owner who say, yeah, yeah, we can do that. We can do that this way. We can do that that way, and then say fine, figure it out, let’s set a goal for a couple weeks from now, show me what you can do.

Fred Fowler: That’s the way to do it, yeah. And any other way of doing it, say okay, we are going to hire a SCRUM master. We need to have a 15-minute meeting every day and we need to do this, we need to do that. That’s all missing the point. If you get those conditions right, then the SCRUM framework falls into place naturally, because it just makes sense.

Fred Fowler: Each of the different events have a purpose when you have people who are playing those roles, understand the roles and are accountable for them. The sprint planning meeting at the beginning is a negotiation between the developers and the product owner about what they can do. When the negotiation is finished, they shake hands, product owner lets them be, is there to answer questions, but then the developers have to figure out how to live up to the commitment they just made. And they need to keep track of what’s going on with each other. That’s why there’s a 15-minute meeting every day, just to make sure that everybody is on the same page about what’s going on. And if somebody’s in trouble, they can fix it.

Fred Fowler: At the end of the sprint, you had the review where in effect, you discuss the results of what you did, you look at the product again and figure out what you could do next. And then at the very end, you have a retrospective where the team gets together and talks about what just happened, is honest with each other, and builds a sense of team cohesion and teamwork. It all falls into place, if you have those initial conditions in place. And if you don’t, then it’s all a bunch of going through the motions, it’s form without any substance.

Meetings Don’t Have to Take Long

Bill Raymond: And someone might say, oh, more meetings, what’s your response to that?

Fred Fowler: My response is, the meetings don’t have to take very long. You still need to have an agreement between the product owner and the developers as to what the heck they’re going to try to do. And if they’ve done proper preparation, if they have discussed all these problems, then the sprint planning meeting can be all five minutes, and say, okay, well, this is what’s on the list and this is what we’re going to do, everybody clear? Okay, fine. Away you go.

Fred Fowler: I’m kind of an iconoclast a bit, because I say, you don’t have to have a 15-minute meeting every day face to face. What is imperative, is that the developers know what’s going on and can spot trouble and correct it. Now that very selfsame example I told you with the kids with cancer thing, those developers met online. And actually, they didn’t meet every day. But they were always on Slack all the time. And whenever they needed to talk, to discuss something, they popped into Zoom and had a video. So those developers were together. They understood what was going on, they knew what each other was doing, they were able to help. They didn’t have a 15-minute meeting every day. 15-minute meeting is not important. What’s important is that developers are working together.

SCRUM Can Start as a Rigid Thing

Bill Raymond: Yeah, what I’ve seen is, when an organization starts going down this path and they start adopting some of these ideas and these concepts, it starts as a very rigid thing. There will be a standup, they call them a standup or whatever you want to call it, the 15-minute, all the team gets together to kind of do the, what’s on my table today, what did I complete, and any kind of roadblocks or whatever. And that’s, I think a fairly common way to go about it. And all of the other meetings that you mentioned, the sprint review.

Bill Raymond: But I do see that they take up a lot of time initially, so everyone can feel like they’re in the cadence and they understand what it is that they’re supposed to be talking about and how. And I also do think it helps with team formation. It helps people get to know how to work together. And even if you did work with people all the time before, but now you’re doing it in a different way, following this framework, you know, there’s terms that might come up that you’re unfamiliar with. You might be consolidating your tools, so there aren’t 20 different ways to update your status of what you’re doing, there’s just one way. There might be different ways that you have to report on how you’re getting work done. All those things, they change. And so I see that at the beginning, everyone stays pretty rigid to the framework.

Bill Raymond: And then over time, they realize, here is how we’re going to do it now because this is what works for us. And I think it’s,I mean, I’m curious to hear what you have to say, but I think that’s okay.

Fred Fowler: Yeah, you know, I’ve had clients where the term "life-sucking meeting" came up a lot.

Fred Fowler: And I say to myself, well, what does all this mean? Well, having meetings, meetings, meetings, really is all about trying to get a handle on what’s actually going on. It’s about transparency, which is a big idea within the SCRUM framework. People are struggling to understand what’s going on, so they have meetings, meetings, meetings, really impeding the ability to get anything done. The SCRUM framework actually reduces meetings. There is no need for status meetings. There is no need for any kind of checkup or coordination meetings because the team is self-sufficient. It doesn’t need to coordinate with anybody else, so it doesn’t need to meet with anybody else.

Bill Raymond: Mm.

Fred Fowler: The product owner doesn’t need to know on a day to day basis about how the developers are doing. Actually, **nobody needs to know on a day to day basis about how the developers are doing, because if there was some implication that somebody had to do something about it, that the developers aren’t working hard enough, well, then that means the developers are not making their own decisions. That means that the developers have an excuse for not performing. **

Fred Fowler: The only status reporting that is necessary is at the end of the sprint, when the product owner says, okay, either you did what you said you were going to do, or you didn’t do what you said you were going to do, basically holding the team accountable for what it said it would do.

Fred Fowler: That’s the only status reporting that’s necessary. So actually, the SCRUM framework reduces a lot of those, forgive me, those BS meetings, because they’re not necessary. Actually, they’re counterproductive. By the way, everybody knows they’re counterproductive. They waste a lot of time, and all they’re trying to do is to give warm, fuzzy feelings to people about what’s going on. We don’t really know how to measure the value of what’s happening. I’m sorry if I have a kind of pet peeve about

Fred Fowler: that

Bill Raymond: No, I think it’s fair. I will be the first to admit that I used to hold meetings that even I thought were counterproductive. But I maybe I took them on from a previous person or maybe I set them up because it was a critical time in the company at that time, and then we just kept it going forward because it was a recurring thing on the calendar. And finally, someone just says, I’m fed up, and then we all say, yeah, maybe we don’t need that meeting. And it just gets canceled and no one cares and nothing breaks and everything’s fine.

Bill Raymond: So one of the things that you might do as you’re starting to think about implementing something like this, is to take a look at your existing meeting cadences and see what you could just X off the calendars for people, so that you can free up to do these other smaller, lightweight things that SCRUM provides.

Bill Raymond: Are there any other takeaways that someone could use after they listen to this podcast?

It’s About Accountability

Fred Fowler: Yeah, yeah. Again, it’s all about accountability.

Fred Fowler: If you’re a director or a VP or somebody like that, and you assign somebody to be the product owner, that person needs to be accountable, needs to make decisions and be accountable. The worst thing in the world is for people to make decisions but not be accountable for the results. And so if you assign somebody to be a product owner and they want to do something and you overrule them, guess what? Now you are accountable for the results, not them. And so when you overrule somebody, you’re really taking away their accountability, and you don’t want to do that. You want people to be empowered to make decisions, sometimes make bad ones, but learn from them, but ultimately be focused in and make decisions and be answerable for the results, good or bad.

Fred Fowler: If somebody makes a killer decision that makes a lot of money, they need to get all the credit for that. They’re accountable. They’re accountable for their success as well as their failure. And sometimes stuff happens and things fail, but c’est la vie.

Bill Raymond: Fred Fowler, this has been a fantastic conversation, and I really appreciate your time today. Is there some way that others might contact you if they want to reach out and further this conversation?

Laura Pirro: agile was mentioned and more specifically SCRUM was mentioned

Mark Kilby: We could still use SCRUM in that case.

Nate Greenberg: we have a morning standup, looks like SCRUM.

Dan Ionita: this risk assessment process is aimed at creating awareness regarding security within the SCRUM team.

Hrishikesh Kareka: What that definition of agile means is, is often very problematic It could just mean that we start to do SCRUM and that does not bring agility.

Reama Dagasan: product lifecycle management or SCRUM

Nader K Rad: SCRUM is one framework that is agile. It’s one way of being agile. So, before talking about what a SCRUM is, I really strongly believe that we should talk about the concept of agility.

Bill Raymond: Hi, this is Bill Raymond, the host of the Agile and Action Podcast. We have recorded more than 80 podcasts that cover a wide array of topics related to business agility. While I just shared a few clips from our library of work. You may have noticed one word come up more frequently than any other, and that is the word SCRUM.

Bill Raymond: So that’s what I’m going to do is share with you some different ideas over this next season. This fall and winter 2022 to 2023 season. To cover more topics on SCRUM. Now, we’re not going to just talk about SCRUM. We’re going to have some other interesting guests as well, but I am excited to put some focus here on the SCRUM framework for you.

And I want you to be aware that we are doing this because of your feedback that you would like to learn more about this framework.

Bill Raymond: As always, I want to thank you for being part of the Agilent action podcast community.

        <content>Successful change management is the result of navigating people through resistance. Laurie Sudbrink makes the case that leadership must come from a place of GRIT: generosity, respect, integrity, and truth.

Laurie shares that GRIT is more than a formula; it takes the form of empathy, vulnerability, taking part in the change, understanding emotional responses, and taking conscious actions based on your beliefs.

Laurie Sudbrink: When we look at Generosity, Respect, Integrity, and Truth in that way, it results in that sustainable success, that sustainable GRIT. We can keep going because we’re not sabotaging ourselves, we’re really aligned properly in respecting ourselves and others.

Bill Raymond: Hi, and welcome to the podcast. Today, we are joined by Laurie Sudbrink, president and founder of Unlimited Coaching Solutions and author of “Leading with GRIT.”

Introduction

Bill Raymond: Hi Laurie, how are you today?

Laurie Sudbrink: Hi Bill, I’m great. It’s such an honor and privilege to be here. Thank you.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I’m really excited for the conversation. I’m also excited to learn what GRIT means.

Laurie Sudbrink: Yeah.

Bill Raymond: I know it’s an acronym, but we’ll get into that. But before we get started, could you share a little bit about yourself and your background?

Laurie Sudbrink: Yeah, sure. I started my business in 1999. But I want to go before that and talk a little bit about my upbringing. Because it has to do with what I’m passionate about. I was raised in a very large family, 13 brothers and sisters, and some of us might remember The Brady Bunch. We used to call ourselves, “The Crazy Bunch.”

Laurie Sudbrink: And I was the middle child. And as you can imagine, I’m always trying to get everybody to get along and, you know, do all of that. And we were raised with grit. We were raised to be tough, tenacious, push through, make things happen. And in that, I learned to really keep going and work extremely hard.

Grit Starts to Get in the Way?

Laurie Sudbrink: And that worked well for me for quite a while. And then I noticed that it started to get in the way a bit. For example, when I was very young and I was a single mom, I was taking classes and working full time. I was lugging my daughter to classes with me. I mean, you get the picture, right? And I was just so hyper-focused on getting perfect grades.

Laurie Sudbrink: I was really neglecting, sadly, my, probably my daughter, my social relationships, definitely my health. At the end of every semester, I ended up sick and I just finally saw the pattern. It was with the help of a good coach, but he helped me see that. And it was like, wow, I’m doing this to myself. That grit that got me so far was now getting in the way, because I wasn’t really thinking of everything in my life. I was just hyper-focused on that one thing. And I noticed this later on in my career, when I first became a supervisor, too. I started to do the same thing. I started to just really hyper-focus on work, work, work, and my career at the expense of some other very important things in my life.

How the Book Came to Be

This is really important to the work that I do, because I notice this in executives, in directors, in managers even, and in individuals, definitely in the workplace. And this grit, grittiness, this toughness was causing collateral damage. And so that’s really how the book came to be.

Laurie Sudbrink: I had um, been doing this work for quite a while and we, just a real short story, staff and I were in a room doing some brainstorming on, you know, putting a name to this and putting a formula to it. And we had these words all over the room. It was, um, the whiteboards all over the place. And I remember seeing generosity, respect, integrity, and truth, but I saw the GRIT acronym and I was like, GRIT! And I just kind of yelled it out in my, I remember my team saying, what about GRIT? You mean John Wayne, True Grit? And then we got laughing, talking about movies, and so it was just, so it was like this really wild, crazy brainstorming, but that is how it came to be because it was the perfect explanation and roadmap to help people lead a successful life and lead a successful company.

Laurie Sudbrink: And so I won’t unpack GRIT yet, but I just wanted to give you that little background because that’s how the book came to be, as really, I wanted to put this down into a book so that people could just take it. I mean, I can’t do this in every single workplace everywhere for every person. And I was like, just, if you read this book, it’s guaranteed to shift your thoughts and beliefs about things which make taking action and that behavior so much easier.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, thank you for that, that’s a great story. Wow. I had a brother and that was already enough for me. So I’m actually, I don’t know how you did it but yeah, congratulations on surviving.

Laurie Sudbrink: Yeah. I had one daughter after that many siblings, so.

I understand. So yeah, I actually really enjoyed your book and I will say, you said the word “read” there. I’m an audio person and it is available in audio book. And we’ll get to that a little bit later, but I really appreciated. You actually read the book, which it was kind of interesting because now I’m talking to that person I’ve been listening to for the last few days.

Laurie Sudbrink: Yes, yes. I decided to do my own audio. Yeah.

Bill Raymond: And you did a great job. I really liked the book, I I appreciate it. And you know, there’s some great quotes from all the philosophers, like Robert Mondavi and Bob Marley’s in there too.

Handling Change

Laurie Sudbrink: Oh, thank you. One of the biggest themes is to be able to handle change. One of my chapters in that book is on change and to be able to look at change differently.

Laurie Sudbrink: You know, again, going to your thoughts and beliefs about it, is one of the most important things and, you and I both know of course, Agile in Action, you know, you are about change. And it really is though one of the most important roles of a leader, is to be able to not only embrace change, but to take action, drive change, get other people to change with less collateral damage.

Change Management

Bill Raymond: I would like to hear how you think of change management, either for an organization or for a person.

Laurie Sudbrink: Yeah. Change management to me is helping to reduce the amount of resistance to change, right? It’s helping people navigate through those feelings and emotions and the why behind the resistance, because resistance is really a way for people to protect themselves. They’re trying to protect themselves against those changes that are going to happen in their job, their work behaviors, their performance measures, even power and status at certain levels. And people get really comfortable doing something and then it takes effort to make a change. So the more that people believe that their current habits and their patterns are going to be impacted, the more resistance we see.

And so a leader’s job is really helping people to see, you know, that it’s beneficial for them in some way. How does it impact them, get them involved in this so that they can be a part of the change and not just have it thrown at them. That to me is change management, is really kind of an immersive everybody’s involved kind of system.

Bill Raymond: I remember I was going through a very large change project. Actually, it was my very first large change project. And you know, I was young, just kind of finishing some academic level work. And I kinda got thrown into this multinational project. The plan was to implement software, but that software meant that maybe people would lose their jobs.

Bill Raymond: And I had a huge blind spot there because I’m just thinking, technical implement the software. And I couldn’t understand why everyone kind of hated me as I was traveling around meeting them. And I realized that I wasn’t in any way recognizing their roles and, and how that might affect them.

Bill Raymond: Even though there was a concept at some point, that maybe their roles would be changed or replaced, it never really did happen. So that kind of makes me happy. But at the same time, that was a big blind spot for me.

Recognizing Change is Happening

Bill Raymond: I don’t know if you have a story or something you can share, you know, how you can recognize that change is happening and how your behaviors can affect that?

Laurie Sudbrink: Yeah, and thank you for that story, because I think all of us can think of times when we had an awareness that we didn’t recognize what somebody else was going through with that change. We’re so focused on driving the change or doing our job, that it’s hard sometimes to step back and think about, well, how are people going to accept this change? The biggest resistance is that they’re not accepting the change itself. It’s not that the change initiative is bad, right? It’s that they just are resisting because of those reasons I just talked about earlier, they don’t want their habits, their patterns, their status, any of that to change.

Laurie Sudbrink: And the thing that popped in my head when you were talking, Bill is, I was working with a very large hospital and one of their goals, one of their new goals was to reduce readmissions.

And so right away, the CNAs, the LPNs, the charge nurses that they knew this meant more work, they knew it meant a disruption in what they were used to doing. And they knew it just, you know what I was hearing, the buzz was, “more changes from the top,” you know, that kind of thing.

Laurie Sudbrink: And I was working with this hospital and they wanted me to help with how to do this with this group. So I said, let’s back up. I want to look at your last employee engagement survey. And the biggest complaint that I heard on that survey was a lack of listening to them. The nurses, actually, one of them commented, I remember the comment was something like, I hope you start listening to us or something like that. And it was like, whoa, you know? And so I’m working with this group and it’s CNAs and, you know, a group of different levels of nurses, the RNs, the LPNs . One of the initiatives we were working on, was they, it, it was uh, to prioritize the patient’s understanding of the discharge instructions. Because what they found was, the readmission was happening because patients weren’t understanding discharge, and then they weren’t doing the right things, and then they were ending up back in the hospital.

Laurie Sudbrink: And so the thing that I heard about the listening and stuff right away, I was just like, okay, we’ve got to get them involved, engaged, right away, so that they feel like they’re a part of it.

Laurie Sudbrink: So instead of going in and telling them, okay, we need to do this, this, this, and this, we got everybody together and we said, let’s brainstorm ideas for this. First let’s back up and say, do you think this is true? Do you think this is a problem, do you think that we do need to work on this in some way? And unanimously everybody, of course it is, of course we don’t want readmissions, of course this is an issue. As soon as they started to brainstorm, it was hard at first. I remember they were kind of thinking of all the things that they’d already thought of and really, going back to not trying to do anything more, you know, it was kinda like, let’s not make this too hard.

But the more that we laughed and had fun and had a really safe environment to be heard, allowed them to vent, we had different, you know, flip charts up. And we had some that were like, this is the venting flip chart. This is the ideas flip chart.

Laurie Sudbrink: And I didn’t do it in a traditional brainstorming where, you know, only good ideas, and you can’t say anything negative instead. We just, we put them on different parking lots, so to speak.

Laurie Sudbrink: And what I saw happening is they were laughing more, they were loosening up and they were starting to feel safe about being able to bring up all of the issues and somebody was listening to them, and somebody was hearing them. And we did have some of the leaders in the room as well so that they could hear all of this.

Laurie Sudbrink: And what they came up with really, was very simple. It didn’t take them a lot, but they wouldn’t have done it. I think they would’ve resisted, had the leaders came in and said, listen, I need you to create a sheet with instructions for these people, and I need you to verbalize this more simply. But yeah, this is exactly what they came up with.We knew, the leaders and myself, what we wanted to see. And we were ready to lead them, but we didn’t even have to.

Laurie Sudbrink: We took a little, little more time probably than it would’ve, probably a lot more time, actually, maybe like three times as much time as it would’ve taken to tell these people what to do, but it, there was no resistance. They jumped in, they volunteered. And so that investment upfront had huge payoffs and dividends later because it was theirs, you know?

Laurie Sudbrink: And they actually went to thisdegree of putting the one-sheet instructions, like colorful and stuff. And then they said, a lot of people are going to lose it, let’s make sure we mail it or email it to them afterward, depending on what kind of communication channel they have. So the whole thing was listening and having them involved as early as possible. Now, they probably should have been involved earlier with this, but we did the best we could with the time that we had.

Listen, Acknowledge, Follow Up

Laurie Sudbrink: So it did take some time to get them to warm up to it. One of the best things you can do is, as early as possible, get people involved and really listen to them. I use an acronym called LAF, L A F. It’s called Listen, Acknowledge and Follow up or follow through. And if we can listen, acknowledge and follow up, that’s the formula that people are going to feel validated.

Laurie Sudbrink: They’re going to feel like, yeah, I’ve been heard. Even if I, you can’t do what they want you to do. Just coming full-circle with that loop helps people build trust and helps them to really embrace, and be a part of the change that’s going to happen.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, it’s interesting. When you go to certain places, I’m thinking about a rental car facility, for example. You know, you go and they’re like, do you want the rental car insurance? And I’m saying, oh, well, no. And then they say, well, I am told that I have to tell you that if you don’t get that insurance, then you know, any horrible thing could happen and you know, then you’re not going to get it, and they put a little fear, uncertainty and doubt in you. But you know what? You also see, you see these blank eyes, these people that are like, they’re telling me to say this, and it does not work for me. This is not how I communicate.

Bill Raymond: And so I could imagine if these individuals receive this message from on-high, maybe they would’ve just asked someone on their spare time to type up something a little bit more wordy, that everyone could use as a template, as opposed to everyone saying, we’re all bought in.

Ask, Don’t Tell

Bill Raymond: And also I love that message that you said where they said they even created follow up messages. So it actually turned into something that they owned as opposed to just this task that they had to complete because someone told them to.

Laurie Sudbrink: Oh, I love how you wrapped that up, because that’s exactly it. They owned it, they felt it was theirs. And by bringing them into the process and letting them feel like they were a part of the solution. Obviously, throughout this, they were seeing and hearing and sharing how it was going to make their job easier. It was all going to help them as well, so it was a win-win-win. But they needed to come to it together, not be told that. And as you and I both know, great leaders ask, they don’t tell. If we’re telling all the time, that’s too easy to resist. If we ask, we bring people along.

All About Empathy

Bill Raymond: I guess a lot of what you just talked about was just empathy, you know, recognizing the people that you’re with and recognizing that they have a hard job and now they’re being asked to do something else. So let’s figure out how to make this easier for everyone.

Laurie Sudbrink: Oh, my goodness, it’s so true. Everybody doesn’t naturally have empathy. It’s one of those things, some people have more of it, some people have less, but it is without a doubt, something we can develop. And so if you find you know, you are somebody listening right now and you’re like, okay, I don’t feel like I have a lot of empathy. There are definitely ways to learn to get more empathy. You know, emotional intelligence is a huge topic right now, and Daniel Goldman wrote a great book on emotional intelligence, just some simple activities like,you could watch TV, you could turn off the volume and you could just try to guess like, what the emotions are somebody’s feeling and then take it to the next level and go, well, what if that were me? How would I feel? And so that’s one little exercise where you can sit and do some people-watching somewhere. And of course, don’t let them know that you’re staring at them or anything, but just try to think about it, be aware of it and then try to put yourself in that person’s shoes. And you can exercise that muscle.

Change Thresholds

Laurie Sudbrink: But when you talk about empathy, I think how important empathy is to consider change thresholds, right Bill, because people have so much change going on in other parts of their lives. There’s just so much we can handle. And we need to understand this about people, right? And change thresholds are going to be different for each person. How much change I can handle can be completely different than how much change Bill can handle. So knowing our people is really important and understanding that there are change thresholds. This is not the only change in this person’s life, right?

Different Levels of Change

Bill Raymond: And there’s probably some steps of change as well, some different levels of change that we need to go through personally and with our colleagues. Do you have any that you might share?

Yeah. In fact, in my book I share the five steps of change. And so I’ll give you the short of it here. And you can use this for any kind of change that you’d like to implement. Say you want to quit smoking or lose weight or get a better attitude or change something in your department or your organization. These five steps are a great roadmap to get there.

Step 1. Self-awareness

Laurie Sudbrink: And the first step is self-awareness. Most first steps are, right? It’s like, what’s going on with me? Where am I right now? So you might have to be aware of my resistance or somebody’s resistance to change, or if I’m the leader and I’m trying to roll out some change, I might need to be aware of what I’m doing or not doing to help this or hinder this. So it’s really about self-awareness at that point. The awareness could come from someone else. Somebody could tell you, maybe it’s your significant other there and they’re like, you know, your, your pants look a little tight there, or you know, something like that and you’re like, wow, you know, and it doesn’t feel good, or maybe a boss tells you something, some feedback. And the awareness is kind of like that, it’s that ability to be aware without a lot of judgment and taking it personally and stuff. Just being objective and being aware is really important at that level.

Step 2. Desire

Laurie Sudbrink: Then we go to desire. That’s the second step. It’s the, “what’s in it for you,” for example, to make the change, right? Why? Why is this important? Sometimes we’re motivated more by pain than by pleasure, so we might need to talk about what might happen if we don’t do it, you know, or what will happen if you do do that? I know for me, I use the five steps of change definitely when I wanted to get healthier in my life. And when it really hit for me, the awareness and the desire was when my dad was passing away of cancer. And I realized at that moment, my real “what’s in it for me,” I wanted to be healthy for my grandchildren. I wanted to be there and have fun with them. That was a real desire for me.

Laurie Sudbrink: Now, a kind of superficial desire that I’d had in the past was, oh, I want to look good. And it didn’t last, I’d go up and down with my weight, you know, that kind of thing.

Laurie Sudbrink: And so we need to find something that is really meaningful for us, that desire.

Laurie Sudbrink: If we don’t embrace that, we’re not going to make the change.

Laurie Sudbrink: So that’s why earlier, when I said, leaders need to help people see what’s in it for that person, see the why behind it, that’s their desire. And it helps them to make that change. So that’s the second step.

Step 3. Knowledge

Laurie Sudbrink: Then we need to know how to do it. That’s knowledge. The third step is the knowledge, and there’s so many places we can get knowledge. We need to find out how to go about this. And you can get people involved in that. We can brainstorm, like the example that I gave. You can find a mentor, have a coach, get a great book on how to do this. You can search the internet for almost anything, just make sure that it’s something that’s valid, reliable, and it works for you.

And that’s the thing with knowledge, there’s so many different ways to lose weight, to quit smoking, to become a better leader. There’s lots of different ways out there. It’s finding what fits for you, what’s going to work for you.

Step 4. Taking the Action

Laurie Sudbrink: And so then the next step, which I find, for myself included, and most people that I work with, this is the one where it’s the hardest. It’s taking the action. There could be a gap there. And the biggest reason that I have found, Bill, is it’s some sort of fear, fear that I have to change my habits, fear that I might fail, fear that I might succeed. There’s all these underlying fears. So it’s important to break it down and set up a plan that’s doable for you, and take those steps and move forward and just keep moving forward and not beat ourselves up when we don’t move forward fast enough. You know, being patient and making sure that we have some way to help us stay on track with that.

Step 5. Perseverance

Laurie Sudbrink: The last step, is perseverance.

Laurie Sudbrink: And of course, we’re going to fall off the horse, right? We’re going to make a mistake, we’re going to trip up. We’re not going to be absolutely perfect. And so that perseverance is about being able to just get back on track, make sure that for example, in a company, you’re trying to implement some change, make sure that you have debriefs and feedback loops and opportunities for people to talk. What’s working? What’s not working? What do we need to do differently and get back on track with things? And so those are the five steps of change. They’re guaranteed to work if you use them. I recommend writing those down somewhere or, I have a resource library. We could always put it in your show notes, I didn’t tell you this ahead of time, but I have a resource library that I’m happy to share. It’s free stuff, and the five steps to change are in that resource library. They’re also in the book as well.

Laurie Sudbrink: If you have this in front of you, it helps you remember. “Make sure I’m aware.” And then, “what’s in it for me?” That desire. How am I going to do it? The knowledge. Take the action and then keep going, that perseverance.

Bill Raymond: Oh, that’s great. Thank you. It’s interesting, I was just thinking about this because, you know, we’re in this time of really significant change right now. First we had the pandemic start and all of a sudden, shockingly, there was more work for everyone to do. In my mind, when the pandemic hit, everyone was going to lose their jobs.

Laurie Sudbrink: Yeah.

The Great Reshuffle

Bill Raymond: But for the most part, I mean, yes, I know restaurants got hit hard. I know that there’s a number of areas that were very much hit hard, but you watched stock prices skyrocketed, companies were hiring and things like that. And then there was this sort of great thing where everyone just said, what was it?

Laurie Sudbrink: Well, some people call it “the great resignation”. Is that what you’re talking about?

Bill Raymond: Thank you, yeah.

Laurie Sudbrink: I call it, “the great reshuffle.” I don’t think people are really resigning, I think they’re finding something else.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, and

Laurie Sudbrink: that’s absolutely what’s happening. I was just talking to someone who said that their friends just decided to retire early and open up a hotel. Yeah, it’s not like I’m quitting, you know?

Bill Raymond: Right, exactly. So “the great reshuffle,” I like that. And then all of a sudden, now we have inflation and companies are laying people off. And of course, you and I have kind of been through that. Certainly, I’ve been through the times when inflation was, I was scared. I went through the dot-com bubble.

Bill Raymond: And I just remembered how some organizations handled it over others. I remembered one of the first organizations I worked with, they just said, listen, times are tough, you all need to just sort of either get work done or you know, we’re letting you go.

Bill Raymond: And then you had the other organizations that had this awareness, this desire, this knowledge, and they said, look, we are probably going to have to let people go, and I’m so sorry about that. But listen, we have a strategy. We have a strategy to work through this, and we have a strategy to get out of this, and this is what we all need to focus on. And this is where we need you to put your attention. And that all went up, it went through emails, it got communicated during meetings.

Bill Raymond: And that’s what I think one of the things that I kind of took out of what you shared here was, to go through those steps helps you be a better communicator, but also, we almost call them steps, as in when you start at the bottom and you work your way to the top, they’re done. No, you have to keep going up and down those steps.

Laurie Sudbrink: Yeah, you keep looping around those steps. Yes. I love the way you said that Bill, and yeah, it does. You’re absolutely right. The communication and the encouragement and the being truthful, being as transparent as you can be,to gain people’s respect and trust through this, the reality of what’s happening.

Even in the second example that you gave, it wasn’t like, yay, we’re, you know, we’re getting laid off, but it was like, we’re sorry, this is just, this has to happen, but we’re going to do the best we can and we’ve got a strategy, and that gives people confidence and it gives them hope.

Bill Raymond: One of the things that I’ve seen and you probably have too in your 30 years of business, it’s like, you see things turn around, you do see things happen that you didn’t think were going to happen. I’ve seen that so much with change initiatives and early on, when I worked at a company, I remember they were going to have a big layoff and they didn’t want to tell a bunch of people because they were afraid they’d start to, you know, opt out and just disengage and stuff. And they did change their mind and had a good conversation about it and said, Hey, we’re going to do everything we can. And it actually did come back around and they didn’t have to lay off hardly anybody. So it was like, you know, it’s better to have that positive energy and focus and realism. Of course, it’s not all about just being positive, but it’s doing the best you can with what you have, and treating people the right way, instead of your first example, you know. It’s like, buck up or get out, you know. It’s like, no, that doesn’t work. Yeah, people will just be worried about their jobs, they’re going to be angry at the way their company’s treating them, and then they’re going to be so worried about their jobs, that they might also throw other people under that proverbial bus, so that they can stay in their job, as opposed to saying, oh, we all need to work together now and get this thing back on track. And yes, we have the strategy, let’s all work towards that.

Bill Raymond: There’s a whole different way in which your organization will work through that. And I think the best ones and the ones that last, are the ones that care enough about how they communicate.

GRIT

Bill Raymond: We have moved through quite a bit here, but we still need to talk about GRIT. And I really want to get into that topic with you because it is how you framed this entire book. And I’d like you to talk a little bit about that. So maybe what you could do is just start by, if this works for you, identifying the GRIT acronym for us.

Laurie Sudbrink: We’re not talking about the old school grit here and, you know, old school grit to me has two problems. It’s when we’re only focused on being tough, then we run the risk of alienating people, running over people, ruining relationships. And secondly, it’s exhausting. We can burn out. And so that’s where my GRIT came in, and I like to have fun with it and call it “true GRIT.” You know, this is the true GRIT, capital G R I T.

Generosity

Laurie Sudbrink: And so generosity is so that you can give and receive. It’s a feeling of abundance. It’s a feeling that there’s enough time, there’s enough people, there’s enough focus, there’s enough to go around.

Respect

Laurie Sudbrink: Respect is so that you’re mindful and objective about things. You respect where people are, you respect the differences, you respect that you don’t know everything.

Integrity

Laurie Sudbrink: Integrity is so you’re aligned and you’re authentic. It’s not that you’re perfect, but you’re genuine. And we talked about that just a little while ago.

Truth

Laurie Sudbrink: And then truth is so that you know yourself and you accept yourself.

Laurie Sudbrink: And while that acronym is Generosity, Respect, Integrity, and Truth, and those characteristics stand really strong on their own, what I’ve done Bill, is I’ve inverted that acronym and started with Truth because it all starts inside. You know, GRIT, starting with Truth provides the roadmap to creating sustainable change and success without collateral damage. When we start with the truth on an individual level, you could look at, who am I? What are my thoughts and beliefs? What am I passionate about? What are my strengths and limitations?

Laurie Sudbrink: DISC is one of the tools that we use in the workplace to help people understand that everybody has their natural tendencies, strengths, limitations, all of that. It’s a, safe way of taking a look at who I am as an individual, one piece of who I am.

Laurie Sudbrink: So truth, is all about being able to look at ourselves objectively and accept ourselves. And so I just want to say for the organizational level, it would be the same thing, right? It’d be able to look at the organization. Do a SWAT analysis. What are the Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities, Threats? That would be like the truth of the organization.

Laurie Sudbrink: The next level is going to integrity. Integrity is the action on your truth. So on an individual level, if I say, health and wellness are really important to me, but yet I go home and like lay on the couch and eat Snickers bars all night, that’s not being in integrity, right? I’m not aligned with what I say is important to me. So it’s the action of your truth and it’s not about being perfect, but it’s about doing your best, aligning yourself to what you know is important.

Laurie Sudbrink: If you know you need to make some change, it’s about identifying what are those, maybe two-degree shifts you need to make in your thoughts and beliefs, your thinking, your actions so that you can make that change. That’s integrity.

Laurie Sudbrink: And then respect, it starts with self-respect. Well, if you know, and accept yourself and you align your actions to what you say is important, you already are showing self-respect, that you respect yourself.

Laurie Sudbrink: And it takes self-respect in order for us to really be able to genuinely respect other people. I respect that I don’t know everything about your truth, you know? I respect that people are different, the DISC styles. I respect and appreciate that, and I welcome those differences.

Laurie Sudbrink: Once we have respect for other people, generosity flows naturally. So we’re aligned properly and we’re giving in a way that’s authentic. It aligns with who we are and it takes a lot less effort. We feel more abundance rather than scarcity. So we actually want to have those one on ones and give feedback, because we know we’re helping the person, because we know how important it is. We ourselves are whole enough, our cup is full, “it runneth over.” We can give to other people, you know, we don’t feel like, oh, I don’t have enough time to do that and I’m so stressed out.

Laurie Sudbrink: So when we look at Generosity, Respect, Integrity, and Truth in that way, it results in that sustainable success, that sustainable GRIT. We can keep going because we’re not sabotaging ourselves, we’re really aligned properly in respecting ourselves and others.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, that “sabotaging yourself” thing resonates well with me. this is prior to having listened to your book. You share some really great personal stories in it, but I know that when I was. kind of going through a moment in my career where I just felt like I wasn’t always getting that respect that I thought I deserved. And I started really listening to, this is going to sound horrible, but I’m going to just say it, you know, I started listening more to people that I did not have a lot of respect for myself.

Laurie Sudbrink: Mm-hmm.

Bill Raymond: And I noticed some traits in them that I had, and it was very difficult, and I, you know, I, I, I, I hate to say this because of course, I want to respect everyone, so I don’t want this to sound like, I’m blowing them off or something like that. It’s just, you know, in my head,there was something there that I just couldn’t connect with, and I didn’t feel likeI could fully trust working with them sometimes. And I started to realize they were doing some of the same things I was doing.

Bill Raymond: So for example,I have a way of communicating where, if I’m put on the spot, the first thing that comes out of my mouth is some sort of a joking quip.

Bill Raymond: If everyone’s really deep into a conversation, I always want to loosen the room with a joke. But what that means is that people were looking for me to speak and instead, I’m making jokes. The other thing that I, I noticed quite a bit is, I kind of grew up doing this, having my own self-deprecating humor. And to me, it sounds funny and people laugh and we have a good time, but I noticed other people that were also using self-deprecating humor. You laugh and you have a good time, but then you’re like, oh, I feel so bad for that person, I wonder if they really think that. And I realized that I actually started to get a lot more people interested inlistening to me and understanding what I had to say, and I felt like I was getting more respect when I pulled a lot of that out.

Bill Raymond: Of course, that’s who I am as a person, so I can’t remove it all. But you know, if I thoughtfully do that, I did find that I was getting a lot more communication and getting a lot further in my personal career growth, the areas that I wanted to succeed.

Laurie Sudbrink: Bill, I love that. And thank you so much for sharing that story, because I think every one of us can relate to that. What I have learned myself is, the things that bother me the most in another person are usually something that I’m doing or I, you know, we’re mirrors for each other if we’re really aware and look at that and be honest with ourselves.

Laurie Sudbrink: And it’s interesting when we start to look inside like that and start to wonder, what it would be like if I did something differently? And yeah, you said something important, it is who you are, but it’s also who you’ve learned to be, you know? And so the five steps of change for example, helps us learn to be however we want to be.

Laurie Sudbrink: And one of the important things that we didn’t talk about yet, that I think is really critical, is being able to visualize that future condition, right? So we’re talking about change and say,I want to stop interrupting people and talking over people at meetings. That was definitely something I was guilty of doing to try to get my point across and overpower, because I’m a DI on the disc style, if anybody listening knows what that is, but that’s a type A. I need to first see myself the way I want to be, believe that I can be that way, and then, that’s part of the self-awareness, that visualization.

Laurie Sudbrink: And then why is it important? Well, I want people to respect me. I want people to listen to me. I don’t want people to cringe when I walk in the room, those type of things.

Laurie Sudbrink: And so being able to visualize that, yes, you can be that person and we can learn and unlearn some of the things that we’ve been conditioned to do to protect ourselves in some way, right? I see a lot of people do that with sarcasm, you know, something will get heated up and then I’ve seen leaders do this, managers do this to employees, and have a kind of funny, sarcastic remark where the person is left, kind of like, okay, so I don’t get to talk about this and you’re just making light of it, and now where do I go with this? And it’s very confusing for that employee, they don’t know what to do with it because the manager was uncomfortable. They didn’t know how to handle that, you know?

Laurie Sudbrink: Those are all opportunities for us and the more aware we can be and see what we want to change, the more opportunity we have to do that, right? To me, it’s about changing our thoughts and beliefs first. It’s about shifting that because our actions follow our thoughts and beliefs. And so shifting that, the why behind it is so important because that will give us the energy, the passion to show up every day and work on it and enjoy it. It doesn’t have to be a hard thing.

Laurie Sudbrink: I know that a lot of my worth, especially early on, when I first became a supervisor and a manager, I would work so extremely hard just for that recognition, that acknowledgement. It was like my drug and I probably was a workaholic if you were to diagnose it.

I definitely ruined relationships. I lost a fiance over it, working so hard, and to me, my excuse was like, this isn’t work, it’s a networking event, I love doing this, you know, that kind of stuff.

Laurie Sudbrink: And it really took that pain, I guess, for me to go, all right, you know, I need to really step back and go, what is important to me in all areas of my life, not just one area of my life? And prioritize those areas of my life and then align my actions to that, the GRIT model. Respect myself by doing that, but also respect that I’m going to fall off, I’m going to make mistakes, but I’m going to persevere and keep working on it. And so GRIT definitely helps us to prevent, I mean, the acronym, GRIT, to prevent that collateral damage by helping us really be more well-rounded, look at ourselves objectively and set out to make the change or, or create the life that we really deserve to live.

Bill Raymond: I appreciate all the stories that you shared. We have a podcast called, Agile in Action, why are we talking about all this? Everything that we talked about here means that we get to be better in our careers and we also get to work great together with teams. And that’s really what we’re talking about here, is that every one of us, when we go to work every day, we want to be happy. And if we can use some of these tools and we all do it together, then we can actually be in a better place.

Bill Raymond: No one wants to turn on that computer in their guest bedroom or whatever, and get onto a Zoom meeting for four hours, and just not like anyone that they’re working with and feel bad about themselves. These are the tools that we can use so that we have that better relationship with ourselves and with work.

Tips for Leaders

Bill Raymond: I am curious though, because we’ve been kind of talking a lot about almost ourselves here. If a leader in an organization is listening to this right now, are there some tips, some ideas that you can share that maybe would help them start to take these concepts on in their organization?

Laurie Sudbrink: Yeah, absolutely. And you know, I want to comment on the agile in action and the relationship between agility and empathy. It’s directly correlated, and so one of the things of course, what we already talked about, is to work on your empathy, ** **practice empathy, seek out some resources if you need to and get some help with that, because that will build trust and people will be more likely to follow instead of resisting. Get the elephant out of the room. Talk about things, communicate openly. If you sense something is up, if you even have an idea that it’s up, create a safe space for that, share your own vulnerabilities in a way that teaches a lesson and helps people to grow from that.

Laurie Sudbrink: So you don’t want to go in there as a leader and just vent, oh, I can’t stand this change either, can you believe they’re doing this again? You know, that’s not the kind ofconnecting and sharing vulnerabilities, but you might say something like, you know, I know how you feel, I can remember when I, we had this change that was coming down the pipe and, ugh, it was just more work that I had to do.

Laurie Sudbrink: You just “feel, felt, found” and you help them to see, yes, you’re real, you know, you can empathize with what they’re going through and here’s what I found. And you give them some ideas of how to rise out of that. And just helping yourself to be more present with people is huge.

Be Present in the Moment

Laurie Sudbrink: One of the best things that a leader can do is work on being present in the moment for short amounts of time. One of my favorite activities is when you’re brushing your teeth, most people brush their teeth at least once a day, and so when you’re brushing your teeth, try to just stay focused in the moment. That’s practicing presence.

Laurie Sudbrink: Now you can brush your teeth walking around the house. I think of everything when I’m brushing my teeth, that’s not the point here. The point is taking an activity that you do that you don’t need to think about and making yourself be present in that activity. Because what that does, is it builds the muscle of being present. And so when you need to go from a busy hectic day and hone in and listen to somebody and be present, you can turn and you can make eye contact and you can do that for 30 full seconds. 30 full seconds of being present is amazing to a person. That builds trust, less resistance, helps them with change.

Laurie Sudbrink: So I would say the last thing would be, start to have regular, really good quality one-on-one meetings. you do not reschedule these, you treat them as a priority because when you reschedule them, you’re telling people they don’t matter, they’re not as important. So it’s very important to keep a good schedule with this. Of course, it’s going to happen every once in a while, just don’t make it a pattern. And then make sure that we know the person well enough, like their DISC style for example. If you know somebody’s an extrovert and they want to talk a little bit in the beginning, let them talk a little bit. The Ds actually just want to get right down to it. So you get in the meeting with them and you start talking about work and then you end the meeting with, so how is your wife doing, how is Johnny doing with the golf? You know, what’s going on with this? And you make a connection with them and really make it a point to make a connection in that one-on-one meeting.

Laurie Sudbrink: And make it genuine, be genuinely curious about your people. In fact, I have a, a template that I’d be happy to share if you want in the show notes for um, how to have effective one-on-one meetings, Bill.

Bill Raymond: And I’m happy to share that. Yes, absolutely. We can put that in the show notes. Thank you for all of this great conversation. I really had a great time talking to you today.

Closing down

Bill Raymond: And I would like to know if anyone is listening to this podcast right now, and they want to maybe talk to you about these topics, can they reach out to you?

Laurie Sudbrink: Oh, I’d love you to reach out to me and you know, I’m very active on LinkedIn, so I’d love you to follow me there. Feel free to private message me if you feel more comfortable doing that on LinkedIn, and mention Agile in Action Podcast in there, so I know where you’re coming from, because I love to make that connection and relate to you in that way.

Bill Raymond: That’s great. And so that’s Laurie Sudbrink, and we’ll make sure that your LinkedIn profile is on the agileinaction.com website. And of course, Laurie’s website, unlimitedcoaching.com will be on there, and your book, “ Leading with GRIT.”

Bill Raymond: And also you’ve mentioned a few different resources as we’ve been talking, The Five Steps of Change, DISC and a template for effective one-on-ones. We’ll also work with you, Laurie, to get all of that information compiled as well.

Bill Raymond: Laurie Sudbrink, this was a great conversation. Thank you so much for your time today.

Laurie Sudbrink: Oh, thank you, Bill. It’s been my pleasure and I love the work that you’re doing. Agility is so critical and keep up the great work. Thank you.</content>

Transcript

(transcripts are auto-generated, so please excuse the brevity)

Nate Greenberg: We need to get the people that can help as close to the people that are having the problem as possible, and eliminating gaps in communication and having that collaboration be forced and effective.

Bill Raymond: Hi and welcome to the podcast. Today, I’m joined by Nate Greenberg, Director of Information Technology for Mono County and the town of Mammoth Lakes, California.

Bill Raymond: Hi, Nate, how are you today?

Nate Greenberg: Hi Bill, we’re great. Thank you for having me.

Today’s topic

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I’m looking forward to our conversation today. We’re going to be talking about dealing with the fast pace of change during a pandemic and, you know, people might think you know, the pandemic started a few years ago, why are we talking about it now? Well, people were in the middle of it then, so now we have some stories to tell and some lessons to be learned. So I’m excited about this conversation today.

About Nate

Bill Raymond: Before we get started, could you share a little bit about yourself and your role as a Director of IT?

Nate Greenberg: Sure. So I’ve been in the technology space for 25+ years or so. A good chunk of that time, I’ve worked for county government, for Mono County specifically. My background is in Geographic Information Systems or GIS, which, you know, is essentially computer-based mapping and analysis. And I came to the county and was responsible for building their first GIS system here.

I served in that capacity sort of managing that system and growing it gradually for little more than a decade and then stepped into the role of IT director. And I’ve been in that role for a little over a decade now.

Nate Greenberg: I sort of have the challenge of keeping abreast of technology here, platforms, best practices, et cetera.

Ultimately, I’m responsible for everything from email to 911. I do a lot of work in public safety, emergency response, disaster preparedness, but I have a staff of 12 in this team. We support about 450 total FTEs across both organizations and, do a variety of different things in sort of the everyday world that we’re there.

Nate Greenberg: And so I have a pretty broad range of experience. But certainly, a lot of it has been aimed at business operations, efficiency and sort of applied technology to try to help improve the way that we operate as a government entity as a whole.

About Mono County

Bill Raymond: Could you just give us a sense for the location of, and what you might see in Mono County?

Nate Greenberg: Yeah, so for those of you who haven’t been, I encourage you to come. We’re sort of wedged on the Eastern side of the state, between the crest of the Sierra Nevada and the Nevada-California border. We’re home to Mono Lake, the Eastern entrances to Yosemite National Park, Mammoth Mountain, ski area. The town of Mammoth Lakes is the one incorporated city here within Mono County.

Nate Greenberg: So we’re about three hours south of Reno, five hours north of LA, six hours east of San Francisco. Beautiful rural community. There’s about 14,000 people that live in roughly 3000 square miles of land. Most of that is public land, about 96% of the land base here is owned by a federal or state entity. And we very much are a resort-based community and a recreation-based economy and lifestyle, so you know, while we’re small in population relative to the geography, we have a lot of demand on us from an organization standpoint. Particular is that sort of lends itself toward public safety.

Nate Greenberg: We have the town of Mammoth Lakes, about 8,000 people in this community year round. We swell to about 60,000 people on busy weekends and the holiday periods, people coming in to ski or bike, hike, fish in the summertime. And so we have a fair amount of impact commercial development, other sort of services that would typically be provided by government that are expected of us, and makes just a really interesting job with a variety of different opportunities in a very beautiful place to live.

Bill Raymond: The last call that we had you convinced me that I need to get over there and ride my bike through some of those areas. It sounds beautiful.

Nate Greenberg: Yeah, definitely encourage it.

Bill Raymond: So let’s talk a little bit about I guess what we might call a case study for all the things that could go wrong during a pandemic and how you have to work through those because I don’t think things generally go right during a pandemic.

Bill Raymond: But you know, my sense is that there is a lot of chaos and you certainly had your fair share of it. So maybe we could talk a little bit about when things really changed a lot.

What was Nate working on prior to the pandemic?

Bill Raymond: What were some of the activities that you would be working on just prior to that?

Nate Greenberg: Yeah, so as I said early, you know, we are responsible for essentially everything that is plugged in and looks or smells like technology. And that’s from sort of the every day applications and expectations that would be coming from our line staff, you know, folks that are working with direct customer relations, internal operations, et cetera, all the way to technology that’s in a sheriff’s vehicle that is driving around in the community. Public safety radio, dispatch, 911, all of that.

Nate Greenberg: So we have for years leveraged agile as a methodology for project management, as well as for the way that we manage our just day to day livelihood and work here. So we’ve basically always used some fashion of that methodology to look at and take what is on any given day about 30 to 50 active projects across this small team, prioritize the work, look at how the task aspects of those projects are being allocated and worked on, and then mixed in with emergent and unexpected requests that are coming at us.

The day to day

Nate Greenberg: And so from sort of a day to day standpoint, what that looks like, is we have a morning standup, looks like SCRUM. We’re looking at new work that’s sort of coming at us and balancing that with sort of work that had been in the queue from prior days, or you know weeks past where we were working on projects.

Nate Greenberg: On a monthly basis, we’re bringing in new projects, things that are not small work requests, but maybe slightly larger or even extremely large projects.

Nate Greenberg: We bring in through a formal intake and onboarding process, review them as a team, try to understand where they are from a priority standpoint relative to everything else, assign resources, and then, you know, start to kind of develop a little bit more of a project plan.

Nate Greenberg: And so we have been using that framework for the way that we operate for the better part of a decade really. It’s always kind of evolved slightly. But it’s served us relatively well, and I think part of what we’ve used as a measure for success is, how are we serving customers and how happy are customers with our service, prior to trying to tweak some of the ways that we were operating and moving into more of an agile methodology.

Nate Greenberg: You know, customer service was okay, but the general findings were that we weren’t very communicative or we weren’t always as responsive and quick at delivering things. And so this has helped us just sort of pivot and really focus where we need to focus and honestly, that changes every day, it can change within the day, and I think through the pandemic, we learned that it can change multiple times during the day.

Going into COVID ad lockdown

Nate Greenberg: So yeah, going into COVID, we had a couple very large projects. One was, we were building or finishing construction of a brand new purpose-built civic center, 110 person, county office building essentially here in Mammoth Lakes. And my team was fully responsible for all of the core aspects of getting that building up and running, networking, you know, all of the fundamental aspects of access control and security and various things like that.

Nate Greenberg: And also because a lot of the services that were being performed by people today are being done via PC, or some form of technology, we were actually coordinating a lot of the move portions of that as well, because we needed to be out of an existing lease and into new building in a very short amount of time, with resources stood up and everything ready to work. And so we were spending a lot of time in weekly meetings with all of the stakeholders basically, effectively, you know, short sprint cycles to try to get this project really well-defined and understood by everybody.

Nate Greenberg: And that’s one example of probably 20 different things that we had going on, I guess in February or March of 2020?

Data center move

Bill Raymond: Did you tell me that there’s a data center involved as well?

Nate Greenberg: Yeah, so our primary data center, we have two for the county. But the primary one in Mammoth was being moved as part of that as well. And that’s used by, you know, really, it’s the primary data center for roughly 60% or 70% of our staff. So there was a fair bit of coordination sort of going into all of that work as well.

Nate Greenberg: And luckily, at that point in time, we weren’t faced with all the supply chain issues and things that we were sort of during and post pandemic, but there was a lot of moving parts and some narrow timelines that we were sort of working around.

Nate Greenberg: So it was a very interesting time. And I mean, I guess just to skip forward a little bit, as soon as COVID hit, the scope of that project completely changed, right? Basically, we were pivoting and instead of trying to move 110 people into a brand new building, we were sending 450 people home to work remotely, and all of the pieces and challenges associated with that became top of list.

Nate Greenberg: And quite honestly, actually the lease from our existing building that we were in, the landlords were very interested in extending, because now all of a sudden there was concern around kind of the bottom falling out of a lot of the market.

Nate Greenberg: And so it was very interesting to see how quickly things could change and how much those changes impacted us and how we needed to react.

Challenges to overcome moving to work-from-home

Bill Raymond: What were some of the challenges that you were faced with? Of course, you said that you had to make sure that 450 people were suddenly working from home and easily accessing their network and keeping your critical systems up and running.

What were some of the challenges that you had to overcome just in that specific area?

Nate Greenberg: In some respects, I think we’re set up for success. We were just sort of halfway through a three-year strategic plan, which was really aimed at effectively mobility and really enabling remote work as a whole. So we are a Office 365 shop here and have invested a tremendous amount in a variety of different mobility products from, you know, Zoom through the Office 365 platform to a lot of cloud computing. But we, I would say, have probably only about half of our staff working on laptops, for example.

Nate Greenberg: So as soon as you start talking about sending home, folks in, you know, social services that are doing child welfare or various things like that, that are connected to state systems, there become a whole host of hurdles you have to clear effectively.

Nate Greenberg: And so there was a lot of work done in those early days to just triage and figure out, okay, what are the highest priority, lines of business and what are the most challenging aspects of each one of those? We were pulling laptops out of e-waste that still had, you know, some useful life on them and putting them back into circulation.

Nate Greenberg: We were buying as many laptops as we could, actually at the end part of 2019, just sort of looking ahead, I think we stocked up on a bunch of laptops, just contemplating that supply chain was going to start to become a problem.

Changed expectations

Nate Greenberg: But ultimately, it was one of those things where we just changed a lot of our expectations. We focused a lot on security and improving access to on-premise resources, effectively through people being able to use home computers and other devices to work. And some of that happened very quickly and some of it took, you know, a couple of weeks, but really, two weeks in, the workforce was generally fine.

Nate Greenberg: but one of the main things that I think happened is, it’s shone a light on a lot of the value of IT and a lot of the work that we had done in the years preceding, and immediately, the value became apparent. The other big thing was that our team basically about five days into the pandemic, kind of split. And we had a group that was focused more on staff and their success, and the other group was supporting the emergency operation center and building tools and utilities and public-facing resources that were used for communicating with the constituency and helping internal operations for managing the pandemic and response.

All of those things were things that we had to stand up and build more or less from scratch. And so we kind of turned into a 24/7 shop almost, and were in full development mode with these very, very short sprint cycles around application development, with features being kind of decided in the morning, testing happening in the afternoon, and releasing the next morning to teams.

Nate Greenberg: And in many cases, we were doing some of that work live. We weren’t even actually doing it in sandbox environments. And so it was a very interesting sort of environment that we were just continually adapting to every single day with new sets of challenges and changes being presented to us.

Application built from scratch

Bill Raymond: Yeah, can you talk a little bit more about that application that you had to build from scratch?

Nate Greenberg: Weleveraged a low-code platform that we’d been working with for a number of years prior to the pandemic here, called Quickbase. It’s a fully open API, cloud-based database platform effectively, that provides the ability to load data in a full relational database model, and then build on top of that a variety of automations, obviously, reporting and analytics, dashboarding, workflows and various things to that end.

Nate Greenberg: And so, what was immediately apparent to us was like on day two, our public health team was trying to do contact tracing for, you know, several hundred thousand plus people, and they were working on Excel spreadsheets. Even though they were in Office 365 and they were shared and allowing for multiple people to work from them, it was not scalable.

Nate Greenberg: There was just a number of issues that started to appear very quickly. And so we basically built from the ground up a application that started as a way for them to bring individuals in the community that they were interfacing with via contact tracing or testing or, you know, trying to sort of run interface and interference with the hospital to keep people out of the hospital as much as possible.

All of those individuals were basically being brought into this system and gradually, as more information was collected by them, the system grew in order to have the capacity to capture that. And some of that had to do with quarantine and isolation, and when people needed to be brought into care and when we needed to put them into temporary housing.

Nate Greenberg: And so we built this application out, which ultimately I think, uh, became effectively the the home for about 18,000 client records. It obviously is all protected health information and you know, skipping forward to today, we’ve actually started to sunset that application, but the core of it has become an electronic medical record for our Public Health Department, which didn’t previously exist.

Nate Greenberg: During those days, every morning, we were part of the department operation center call, that was part of public health that were really dealing with a lot of those public-facing aspects of the work.

Nate Greenberg: And a significant component of those conversations was dedicated to the technology platform, and talking about the needs to, based on some experience that happened the day before, tweak an automation or a workflow or capture new data, or be able to, you know, segment data in different ways. And so it was typically myself and one other person from the team, part of those calls, bringing information back. And we were basically then spending four to eight hours kind of building out new functionality every single day to basically continue to grow that. And it did end up becoming a very center-focused application for not only the public health team, but a number of folks that were in the field providing meals and services, tracking a lot of our assets and inventory masks and, you know, all the typical things that were being used as consumable, as well as looked at by our emergency operations center.

Nate Greenberg: And then the other piece of it is a public facing dashboard. And so we were actually providing to the public real time statistics on what was happening with case rates, what was happening as we got into immunization. All the immunization deployment and tracking and scheduling was done through that application prior to the State bringing their systems online. So we were basically providing real time data to the community based on the work that was being done every day by public health staff.

Bill Raymond: Just amazing, all the things that need to happen and all the logistics involved. I can imagine that you had pressure to make sure the system was up and running and secure, while then also the public health officials were probably receiving all sorts of new information, like a feeding from a fire hose every day as well.

Nate Greenberg: Yeah, meanwhile, we’re still supporting you know, a 400-person workforce that wasn’t fully dedicated to the emergency operation itself, but trying to keep the rest of the facets of the operation of the county and the city running.

Bill Raymond: You said that you were working almost 24/7 on some of these applications and making sure that the IT infrastructure is there for all of these very important people to provide services for the people that live there and even I’m sure, for guests that are visiting the area.

Dealing with Burnout

Bill Raymond: And I have to imagine that there must have been a lot of burnout in those early days. What did it take to kind of get through that? I’m sure there’s sort of a hero mode and then you have to find a way to kind of give people back their lives a little bit as well.

Nate Greenberg: Yeah, it’s interesting, in those first two months or something like that, it was chaos. And there were a lot of impacts on the organization, literally, things were changing multiple times a day. And I was personally working 70-80 hour weeks for multiple, multiple weeks on end, which finally tapered back to, you know, 60 hour weeks.

Nate Greenberg: And we were trying really hard to keep people from ending up in that spot. You know, there were a few of us that were really working hard and heavy, especially on more of the development side of the house. But you know, I think the main thing was really having some cadence and some regular communication with the team as a whole.

I think we were sort of a little bit siloed, just based on the types of work that the team was doing, but we were still having daily standups, to look at you know, triage and incoming requests. We were still having weekly all-hands effectively, just to sort of check in and see where things were going.

Nate Greenberg: I think in some way, while we weren’t truly changing to a shift-like schedule, it became pretty apparent that there were a number of things that needed to happen after hours. And so I just basically said, look, you’re all working more than you normally would be working anyway. I don’t care about when you’re working, let’s just try to figure out how we’re going to parcel out the work, get the work done, and let’s make sure that we’re supporting the normal operations. You know, we still had all of these other big projects, we still had to get into this new building, we still had to get out of these other buildings. And so it was just this constant sort of juggling, if you will

Summer double-impact from Fires

Nate Greenberg: It was interesting too, because as we got further into the summer, we got kind of double impacted with fires. And based on our place, we’re extremely lucky with regard to COVID, you know, I could literally walk out my back door and be in public land. You know, I spent a fair bit of time outside, whereas I know in San Francisco, you had streets closed so that you could get outside and it was a lot harder. Life didn’t feel that different, you know, in the outdoor kind of space. It felt way more different certainly in the communities and indoors.

But as soon as we got impacted by wildfires, we were basically on lockdown just because of smoke and AQI days that were you know, in four digits. You couldn’t see across the street for two or three weeks.

Nate Greenberg: And so that became an interesting thing and how people’s just sanity sort of got stressed, not just from the work, but then kind of feeling like you’re totally holed up, which I know a lot of people in cities felt throughout the entire pandemic.

Overall, I think a lot of it just came down to really being flexible, to being clear and honest and open with people about where they’re at, what they needed, you know, that family balance piece, childcare was chaos, schools were out, blah, blah, blah.

Nate Greenberg: So number one, number two, and number three were communication and regular communication with the team.

The application

Bill Raymond: It’s almost like agile at the speed of light almost, with some of these things that you were doing, especially with thisapplication. It sounded like every time you talked to someone there was more scope creep. But at the same time, you need to be able to do these things, right? If there’s nowhere to manage the inventory of masks, you need to have an application that does that.

The three teams and team dynamics

Bill Raymond: Can you talk a little bit about what that looked like, what that team dynamic looked like, and how you changed over time, as maybe things started to settle a little bit?

Nate Greenberg: Yeah, My team, you know, is kind of divided into three divisions, if you will. One is focused on infrastructure, the stuff that people almost never see, compute, storage, network, you know, the things that are kind of the, the umbilical cord and nervous system of what makes a organization like us be able to leverage the desktop PCs and the other pieces that we all touch as users.

The second team is really dedicated to that group of people, to the support side, the services side, implementation and the like, you know, so it’s really focused on customer success as a whole.

Nate Greenberg: And then the third team, is an applications group. And that group has traditionally been focused on leveraging GIS for mapping analysis, storytelling, communication, dashboards, and the like. As I said, we’ve been a customer of this low-code platform, Quickbase, for better part of 10 years now, actually.

And we’re using it for a number of internal business systems, namely in IT, mostly managing and tracking our work. Our entire project and work management system has been built in that application. And we basically, you know, live, breathe and die in it every single day.

Nate Greenberg: So all of our work requests come in through that, all of our time tracking and management happens through that. All of the project management and prioritization happens through that, you know, licensing and cost accounting and budgeting and all of those things. We’ve basically built a dedicated system on this platform to handle the way that we work.

Nate Greenberg: And so when we became sort of pressed to provide a solution better than Excel, it was a very natural place to go. And we first started to leverage more traditional GIS tools, but based on the complexity of what was needing to happen and the rapidity at which we needed to do things,the low-code platform just proved to be immensely beneficial.

Nate Greenberg: And the, the main reason for it was that you didn’t need to be a developer. This applications team that was fundamentally familiar with GIS, fundamentally understood database, they fundamentally understood web, they fundamentally understood how to produce dashboards and do report analysis work.

Nate Greenberg: And so we basically just started to take the work demands on us and chunk them out and be like, okay, this is a relatively straightforward user interface, user experience type of thing. Who wants to pick this up and run with it? And so these things would come to us either from the emergency operation center team in a more direct request standpoint, or from a public information officer standpoint, around they need to be able to produce new statistics or represent those in a new graphical fashion. Or sometimes from the frontline staff, who were like, Hey, I just got off the phone with somebody, and we don’t have a way to capture this kind of data. And so within the team, there was relatively like a group of four people, myself and three others, We were in constant communication using things like Teams or a lot of Zoom meetings, putting all of the work requests into Quickbase, into our work management system. It was very meta, we were using Quickbase to manage Quickbase projects. All of those requests were coming in and being created into tasks and then basically prioritized using sort of a SCRUM board and the traditional agile methodologies, requirements gathering, et cetera, all of that was sort of captured and then it was all transparent.

Nate Greenberg: So nobody necessarily owned anything until it was taken on, and then they would basically kind of run it to ground, up until the point where they maybe needed support or input from somebody else.

Nate Greenberg: The planning cycles you know were multiple hours, maybe multiple days if you were lucky, but generally, we were in like 24-hour sprint cycles for pretty much everything that we were doing.

Bill Raymond: Oh, that’s just incredible. Congratulations to you and your team for pulling that off. Even with the tools, there’s still a lot of logistics, communication, testing, challenges that come along with deploying anything. So I really want to congratulate you and your team for managing to pull that off and successfully supporting the public and health initiatives that you have there.

Nate Greenberg: Thanks, yeah. I am extremely grateful, I mean, an incredibly talented group of people here and they were all so committed throughout the entire process, but you know, it felt really good, we were recognized for a lot of the work that we did.

Exposure to what’s possible

Nate Greenberg: And I think, you know, more than that external recognition, one of the things that I think was extremely rewarding to see if you will, is that we had a number of people throughout the organization that were pulled out of their normal jobs and put into a role as a disaster service worker or, you know, tasked onto the emergency operations center team, sometimes for a couple weeks, sometimes for months. And as those people got exposed to a lot of the technology that we were putting in place, this application that you know, was growing incrementally over time, they were just blown away at A, how quickly things were getting built and implemented and B how functional and effective they were for what they were actually trying to get done. And as those people returned to their normal jobs, we had a number of them come back to us and say like, Hey, our system for tracking, you know, code compliance cases is a mess. We can’t use it. Is there any way we could leverage Quickbase and you could build us an app for that? It’s like, sure.

**Nate Greenberg:__ **I think it opened people’s minds to better ways to do things. And it’s really driven a digital transformation within the organization much more organically than I think we could have from sort of a top down approach where, you know, people are seeing what is possible and I think imagining it more on their own and now coming to us as a solution architect basically try to bring something to bear for them. **

Nate Greenberg: So that’s been extremely rewarding, and I think that we’ve met a lot of people kind of where they’re at, and we’ve got a long road ahead of us in terms of the demands, but it’s a pretty exciting place to be. And I think we’re doing a lot of really exciting things based on a lot of the lessons we learned over the last couple years.

Bill Raymond: The speed of change that we’re all going to be dealing with, won’t back down for quite some time here. So could you share some of those lessons that you’ve learned that others might be able to take a listen and say, I could use some of these ideas in my organization?

Nate Greenberg: Everybody likes to talk about change management. The reality of it is that it’s a stressful exercise, whether you’re on the driving end or the receiving end of it. And I think the number one thing is, really relationship with the customer, you know, in terms of actually leading and leveraging a team, having an effective team and having the relationships with those people that are the change agents, that really comes down to **trust. And I think **Fundamentally, the success in all of our work really was based on that trust. And I think a lot of that trust, internally within the team existed prior to coming into the pandemic and it set us up well to be effective as a team. Externally with our customers, came from delivery, it came from performance, it came from really hearing what they needed and applying resources and assets to sort of meet their needs.

Nate Greenberg: And so all of that I think, comes back to how do you communicate effectively, and how are you collaborating with people? And I think that it’s a challenging thing to do in a blue skies kind of world. I think you get forced to do it in a cloudy skies, in a pandemic or in a other natural disaster or any other kind of more stressful event.

But the extent to which I think you can have a strong team and really good foundation and trust going into any one of those, you’re going to be set up better to be addressing those unknowns that are being thrown at you.

Get the people closest to the people with the problem

Nate Greenberg: Another big thing is really, we found early on that ** **we needed to get the people closest to the people with a problem. And so those first few weeks, we were receiving requests secondhand, third hand from emergency operations or from folks answering calls. And by the time it would get to us, it was distorted, it was not exactly what was being asked by the person that put in the request in the first place. And you know, we were building stuff and they’d be like, no, that’s not exactly what we expect.

**Nate Greenberg:__ **And so we were just like, you know what, for this to be effective, I’m putting a developer in the ESC meeting, and I’m sorry if you don’t want them there, but if you want to see success being turned around as quickly as you expected, we need to get the people that can help as close to the people that are having the problem as possible, and eliminating those gaps in communication and having that collaboration be forced and effective. **

Nate Greenberg: And that I think really changed the dynamic dramatically. And we saw productivity, success around actually hitting what people expected and ultimately, the efficiency go way up through doing that. There’s no doubt that agile, whether it’s in a very traditional, structured fashion or something a little less perfect, was imperative. As I said, you know, we were in these 24-hour sprint cycles, it was trying to rank a priority that seemed like top of the list from two days ago against one that had come up this morning, that may be more important. And the only way we were able to do that was through those direct conversations with the customer and the, the user requesting it as well as with resources internally, and I think having that real-time communication was just imperative.

Nate Greenberg: If we hadn’t had some of those foundational frameworks of agility already rooted in the team, it would’ve been an interesting pivot, but I think really, because we were used to sort of working in that fashion, we just needed to turn up the volume on it a little bit, if you will.

Nate Greenberg: The last thing is really just that,** I think it’s interesting to see how willing many of us were to be agile and nimble and change during ** more chaotic times.

Nate Greenberg: But now that things are settling, people are kind of getting back into their more traditional ways of operating, and change is feeling hard again.

Nate Greenberg: And so what we’ve been talking a lot about is well, what was it about, you know, 6 months ago, 18 months ago, that was enabling these things to happen that now is not? Some of it was policy and some of it was more regulation, but a lot of it had to do with, I think people were very solution-focused.

Nate Greenberg: And I think really having an open mind and being willing to try to look at what are we trying to achieve, what is the most efficient and best way to achieve it, and not let perfect be the enemy of the good, those are things that I feel like we really should take away and hopefully, many of us do take away.

Recognition of the Work

Nate Greenberg: Yeah, thank you for that, that’s some really good advice. I did hear you mention that you and your team were recognized for some of the work. Could you share with us what those were? We received a couple of awards. There’s a national survey that happens for county IT organizations, called The Digital County Survey. It’s in partnership with the National Association of Counties and we were recognized two years in a row. There’s basically the awards given out based on population. So we were the first place winner two years ago, based on a lot of the work that we did around this application and the quick um, response and a lot of the public-facing things that were sort of put out there and the transparency. And then recognized again, I think as the second place finisher in that same award two years ago, for just some additional work that had been done in that space. A lot of public recognition within the community and a lot of regional recognition within the State. Also, my association of California County CIOs recognized a lot of the work that we’ve done, and I think as we’re pivoting out of the pandemic again, I mean, we’re actually being asked to come and help hand off some of that information to a lot of our colleagues, and we’re seeing other people leverage some of the practices and philosophies that we put out there. Overall, it’s been really rewarding to hear the recognition from staff within our organizations come to us, and, you know, occasionally, I get stopped on the street still and just say, Hey, thanks so much for all the work that you guys did and the information that you put out there.

**Nate Greenberg:__ And so I think **that’s obviously made us feel really good and certainly, throughout the whole pandemic, any time those things came back to us, anytime there was a recognition, it was shared immediately among the entire team. I think it was really important to just continue to help people, know that what they were doing, even as mundane as it may have seemed at the time really, was having an impact out there. **

Nate Greenberg: But I think that that is a really key takeaway too, is make sure that people know that what they’re doing makes an impact and that they are recognized for it.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, that’s great advice. It sometimes does just come down to that, you know, it’s you work all these hours, you’re not sure if anyone’s even paying attention sometimes, and then someone recognizes you for it and it just feels so good, and it kind of gives you that extra burst of energy to keep moving forward.

Transcript

(transcripts are auto-generated, so please excuse the brevity)
Reama Dagasan: I learn really well from parables like Aesop’s Fables or the Greek myths. A lot of those are parables and they’re there to teach you lessons. And I feel like when we get somebody that is applying Agile and talking about it, I’m not sure if it’s exactly a parable, but it feels that way to me.

Bill Raymond: Hi and welcome to the podcast. Today, I’m joined by a very special guest. It’s Reama Dagasan, CEO of PastaBiz, an EMILIOMITI company, and also the executive producer of the Agile in Action Podcast.

Bill Raymond: Hi, Reama, how are you today?

Reama Dagasan: I’m good, Bill. How are you?

Today’s Topics

Bill Raymond: I’m doing great. I’m excited because you’re going to be sharing with us some of the things that you’ve learned about Agile in your personal career. And we’re also going to have a little two-year anniversary retrospective of the Agile in Action Podcast.

About Reama

Bill Raymond: Before we get started, can you just talk a little bit about your background?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, I am a high school dropout who later went on to get her Bachelor of Science in International Studies and later, a Master’s in Business Administration. And I have spent the last 16 years of my career helping small companies get bigger. And I have been with PastaBiz for, gosh, 13 years now. And I have taken some sabbaticals and done other things. I’ve had a couple of interesting side-gigs through my career, but my one constant has been helping companies to grow.

Reama’s Work at PastaBiz

Bill Raymond: Can you talk a little bit about what you do at PastaBiz?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah. So my current title is CEO, and I really just think of myself as the General Manager, but I absolutely wear a lot of hats there at the company. I help with everything from operational things, such as purchasing, procurement, forecasting, getting machines onto the boats, handling finance, HR, accounting. There’s really no aspect of that business that I haven’t been involved with in some way, short of packaging crates to leave our company or repairing machines. I leave those to people that are better qualified than myself.

Bill Raymond: And when we talk about machines, when we say PastaBiz, we really mean pasta as in Italian pasta, right?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, exactly. So people think that we make pasta, but the reality is, if you’ve eaten at a restaurant that has a pasta machine, there’s a really good chance that we’ve sold them that machine. Or if you have purchased fresh, locally-produced pasta at Whole Foods or Sprouts or another similar market, there’s a good chance that’s made on a machine that we’ve brought here to the States.

Reama Dagasan: All of our products come from Italy, with the exception of two specialty items that we source from elsewhere, but there’s a very, very strong Italian connection.

About Pastabiz

Bill Raymond: What are some of the types of equipment that you sell frequently?

our most popular items are extruders, and those are a lot like the Play-Doh sets we had as children. And you fill the thing with Play-Doh and you put on a disc and you push it and out comes a star or a square piece of Play-Doh. That’s one of our most common things, but we also have machines that will make fresh pasta sheets that you can cut into Tagliatelle or Pappardelle, but also Ravioli and Cappelletti machines.

Reama Dagasan: So it’s really, it’s pretty neat. What I really like about the job is, it’s a great product and you’re helping people to produce really beautiful food.

Bill Raymond: There is nothing like fresh pasta.

I’m a fan. I actually finally broke down and bought my first extruder a few months ago, and it has been way too fun to play with.

Agile Techniques Reama likes to use

Bill Raymond: Since you’ve been the executive producer of the Agile in Action Podcast, you’ve had some takeaways. I think It would be cool to hear what you might be using Agile techniques for in your business.

Reama Dagasan: We’re based in San Francisco. I was living in San Francisco and our town was one of the first that decided to lock down in March 16th, 2020. Now, as a company that supports food production, we’re absolutely an essential business, but we then had to quickly pivot, which is a really heavily-used word, but we all had to.

Reama Dagasan: And I sent as many of our people who could work remotely home as possible in order to allow for distancing, et cetera. So we really struggled with that initially, because it’s a very different way of working when you lose those in-person interactions. We had a guest, Sarah Shewell, and she referred to them as I think, “water cooler moments” where you have those brief exchanges of ideas that just come about organically. And so that was definitely a big change for us.

Reama Dagasan: As I have produced this podcast, it’s actually been really helpful to me in my day to day role in that company. It’s Helped me learn better ways to create team cohesion. It’s taught me or refreshed my memory about avoiding communication silos, which was something that I learned in business school back in I want to say 2006, 2007, 2008 were the years that I attended while working. And Agile reminded me of this, you know, how important it is to have clear communication with the people you’re working with. And we’re a small company, so there shouldn’t be silos. But we all have to work together, and I think that’s one of my big takeaways from Agile, and that’s a very high-level perspective, but it’s been a nice, consistent reminder that I’ve heard from our guests each week.

Bill Raymond: That’s a big focus of our podcast, that kind of stands us out a little bit. And I know that you play a big part in that, in that we don’t just have a bunch of people talking about how to do software development. We do, but we also talk about how you can run your business more efficiently. We talk about how teams can work together and collaborate together in a better way. And you’ve really been a key element in making sure that happens.

Reama’s perspective on agile

Bill Raymond: So I think from working on this podcast for a while, you have maybe developed your own personal perspective on Agile. And I’m curious what your takeaway is from that term.

Yes, that I feel well equipped to address. So, no,I’m not an Agilist or an Agile practitioner, but for me, the things that I’ve learned from this podcast, from producing and listening, are applicable to anybody that’s running a business.

**Reama Dagasan:__ **And so I feel like the podcast is a lot more than just about Agile. It’s about how to successfully navigate an ever-changing business landscape. **

Reama Dagasan: For example, it’s taught me to ** **communicate better. It’s taught me to hopefully be a better leader with a clear direction, you know, because that’s one of the most important things that I think I’ve learned from this podcast, is that clear sense of like, well, we are here now and where do we want to be?

Reama Dagasan: Agile helps to bring you to that where you want to be.

Reama Dagasan: Like, in our instance, we started with, we want to have a podcast and now it’s, you know, maybe our future goal is we want to have a podcast with 100,000 listeners. So we can use Agile, even in the context of producing a podcast, to help us get there. On a daily level, I think that one of my fun takeaways from Agile has been keeping meetings short. I am now the world’s biggest proponent of a standup. And it’s really interesting because in 2019, before I had started working with you on this podcast, I did a 10-minute meeting every morning with the team to talk about, what is on your plate today? What do you have scheduled? What support do you need from the other people that are here?

Reama Dagasan: And it was the coolest thing when I realized this thing that I had just started was actually, it had a name, it was a standup in Agile. And it was amusing because we would stand up during these meetings to really connote that it wasn’t meant to be a long, long discussion. But it was a chance for us to work, to support each other in our tasks that we had that day.

Bill Raymond: That’s really cool that you had adopted that, and then you were able to connect a name to it after.

Reama Dagasan: Yeah. It’s, you know, this is a real thing. This wasn’t just something that, you know, Reama pulled out of thin air. It’s a very efficient way to cover communication with your team, and a very efficient way to make sure that you guys are aligning what you’re trying to do. And that was the whole purpose, that meeting was to align what we were all working on together that day to make sure that we were supporting and being effective and able to leave, you know, at five o’clock, because we had worked in an efficient andcoherent fashion together.

Bill Raymond: That alignment piece is actually really important that’s the one thing that I always feel very strongly that you do best. You always manage to take a bunch of words that, I mean, someone like me might say,and if it’s not clear, you drill down and you drill down and you do it in a very nice and personable way.

Bill Raymond: You don’t feel like you’re being grilled. And then all of a sudden, we’re in agreement as to what needs to be done, and I’ve always appreciated your ability to do that.

A softer approach to asking questions

Reama Dagasan: Thank you for saying that. I don’t like being put in the hot seat with questions, and sometimes our first answer is not our best answer. And those are things that I try to remember. As much as Agile is focused on doing things in a quick way, by following these iterative processes so that you don’t go all the way back to the drawing board at the beginning, at the same time that speed is important, I’ve also learned that sometimes giving somebody the day to get back to you, ** **or maybe a couple of days, if it’s really important, is actually going to be better because you’re going to have the right information.

Reama Dagasan: You want to make sure that you give whoever you’re working with time to get the right answer that’s the right version, and not rely on their memory when they’re feeling very pressured.

Reama Dagasan: And that’s why I’ve adopted more of ** **a softer approach when asking questions, having a disagreement or trying to get information out of somebody. Fear has no place in the workplace. And so if somebody isterrified because of how I’ve delivered a question or a statement, that becomes a barrier to communication.

Bill Raymond: I really appreciate that thought process that you go through. And it’s hard too, because sometimes when you’re leading an organization, of course you want your fingers on the tip of everything and you always want to know what’s going on. So it’s important to be able to create that space for people to continue to innovate and do what they need to without putting so much pressure on them.

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, or you know, you can make a mistake and it will not be forever held over your head or it won’t be weaponized, because that I feel would crush people’s sense of ownership over work or crush their willingness to think in a new way. And that’s not what we want? It’s like, yes, we sell machines, we work with artists, and we need to be creative to support them.

The Agile in Action Podcast

Bill Raymond: Let’s talk a little bit about Agile in Action, the podcast. I don’t think we talked about this before we started the podcast. It’s got to have been at least five years that we’ve been working together now, right?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, I want to say it was 2017. I was on somewhat of a sabbatical. I was working part-time at PastaBiz. I just needed a little bit of time to kind of slow life down. And yeah, so I started working with you in 2017. And for those that don’t know, I was originally helping Bill with his accounting, because it’s, one of the many hats that I wear. And so that’s how I came to know Bill.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, and I think that’s putting it lightly. I’ve always looked at you as a business partner, because you didn’t just I’m doing air quotes on the screen right now, you can’t see them, but you never just did the books. You were always making sure that this company was successful and you put in that extra work that I actually didn’t have an expectation of, but I’ve always come to appreciate it and still do to this day.

Reama Dagasan: Well, you’re welcome. And that’s one thing I think that’s been true in my career, is I’ve had people who, the company is so new, not necessarily in your case, but I’ve really been able to come in and define what my own position is, and really like take ownership. And that’s been a constant for me and it’s been something I’m really grateful for.

Reama Dagasan: I’ve never really worked at a corporate job and maybe I would have those opportunities there, but the small companies that I’ve worked for have always let me sort of blaze my own trail and create my own systems and structures to help them, and been really receptive and happy about it. So I’m super lucky in that way.

Bill Raymond: We formally worked together as partners on the Agile in Action Podcast for two years. This is actually our two-year anniversary this month. And we have published, I think we’re up to something along the lines of 72 podcasts now. We started off bi-weekly, and now we are at a weekly cadence, just taking breaks for holidays and periods of time when we know people are traveling with family and things like that. But we’ve been going weekly and I just, it’s amazing the breadth of guests that we’ve had.

Reama’s role on the podcast

Bill Raymond: But before I get into that, could you talk a little bit about your role that you’ve played as the executive producer here at the podcast?

Reama Dagasan: Yeah. My first task really was to help find interesting people that could share their knowledge, that would be willing to do this with us. And it started with some keywords in Agile, like, product lifecycle management or SCRUM but it started with a list of keywords and me looking at people and finding articles and people that were, speaking and sharing ideas or authors of books. And over time, my knowledge of Agile has deepened and we’ve gotten at sometimes, a little deeper in the weeds with people that we have on the show. One of my very favorite things to do is like, Hey Bill, this person’s talking about Agile and supply chain management, can we have them on, can we have them on? And you’re thinking, I’m not really super sure about supply chain management, that’s not my field. It is part of my field day to day, but you’ve always been game to go with it and be like, let’s talk to them and see how they’re using Agile in this new and exciting way.

Reama Dagasan: How are people using Agile for information management, for example? So my role is like finding these interesting people with great ideas so that we could share it with the broader world. I had initially anticipated that it would be really tech-heavy, and I’ve been grateful that we’ve brought it out to things that are not directly related to technology, such as the supply chain management, and that’s let me feel like I’ve got to make my own sort of path here in some ways.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, we’ve gotten into it with human resources, marketing, sales, any number of different areas of expertise. And one of the things that I appreciate about what you’ve done with the podcast is, you do put me out of my comfort zone, and I like it. At first, I was a little worried because I thought there were some topics that I was saying, I don’t know how this connects with Agile, or I’m worried that people are going to use words I don’t understand. But it turns out, when you’re just having a conversational podcast like this, it’s pretty straightforward, and people recognize that they have an audience that may not know their business.

Bill Raymond: And it’s pretty rare that we get someone that starts throwing a bunch of acronyms out without explaining them first. And it makes it easy for all of us to have a good conversation, and it expands our minds as to what Agile can do for people outside of that pure software development world.

Reama Dagasan: Absolutely, and I think that is something that I would like to let our listeners know is that, you know, yes, the title is Agile in Action, but I firmly believe that a lot of the topics that we discuss are applicable to any company. There’s lessons that I’ve learned on the podcast that I take with me and we are in no way, shape or form an Agile organization, but the tips, the ideas, the concepts, the information have a thousand percent been transferable over to my day to day life at work.

The podcast editing process

Bill Raymond: Yeah, absolutely, and I feel the same way, to be honest with you. It is interesting because we do have this editing process where we have to sit down and listen to the podcast, and then we just find things like, we do the initial thing, right? Which is listen for dogs barking, babies crying in the background, because everyone’s doing this from home, and then we have to kind of clean up some of the general conversation that doesn’t, you know, work inside the podcast. And there’s a lot of editing there, and I know you spend a lot of time going through that.

Bill Raymond: But one of the things that I’ve always appreciated was the end product, when it’s finally done and you’ve sent it through, to the sound people, and you’ve sent it through all of this editing and we’ve kind of gone back and forth and collaborated on that. When it’s done, I sit down and listen to the podcast. Usually, I listen to it with one pod in my right ear, on a bike ride while I’m in the park and I put it on, and then I learn something. I don’t always learn something in the moment because you know, there’s this sort of drive to keep the conversation going.

Bill Raymond: And it’s amazing how much after having listened to each podcast, four or five times before it goes public, where then I can sit down and say, Wow, look, there’s actually some really good content here.

Absolutely. When I’m editing podcasts, I don’t learn anything, because I’m more focused on, where is the strange sound? But once I’m done with that process and we would get it back from the sound engineer, then I could listen to the whole thing. And then I could take that 30,000 foot view that our listeners are also able to take. And that’s when it all kind of sinks in. Because I had been fretting over words and pauses and little things, but then you get to listen and see the whole thing, you get to step back and see why, this is a great podcast and a great lesson that was not as clear when I was worried about phrasing and ums and uhs.

Finding podcast guests

Bill Raymond: I’m curious, you’ve spent a lot of time helping to find the guests and, I love the range of topics that we have. How do you look at finding guests to make sure that it’s a well-rounded podcast?

Reama Dagasan: I always like to find people doing Agile a little bit different. One of the things that I’ve tried to find, are people that are using Agile in non-software development ways. I like to find people that are practitioners. I’m always very grateful when we can find somebody that is there where the rubber meets the road and is practicing Agile day to day, and can provide us with concrete concepts and concrete application of this idea of Agile. Because I believe that applied Agile is a great way to present this information.

Reama Dagasan: I learn really well from parables like Aesop’s Fables or the Greek myths. A lot of those are parables and they’re there to teach you lessons. And I feel like when we get somebody that is applying Agile and talking about it, I’m not sure if it’s exactly a parable, but it feels that way to me. And it’s easy for me to take that in and I hope that for our listeners, when they can hear how people are using Agile day to day, they understand the appeal of it, but they also feel more empowered to apply it to their day to day. Maybe the whole org doesn’t undergo a transformation, but maybe they change one little aspect of their career and at their workplace, and it’s beneficial.

Bill Raymond: We also have a pretty diverse guest list anyone from a practitioner to someone using it in their own personal work life, executives and team members. And it’s great to have all of their perspectives.

Guests that stood out for Reama

Bill Raymond: Are there any particular guests that really stood out for you?

Reama Dagasan: Yes. I would say that one of my very favorites, because her words resonated so strongly with me was Sarah Shewell and her discussions about supporting people as you go remote and creating those opportunities for people to speak, for them not to be silenced in Zoom meetings, and actively soliciting feedback from people who might otherwise be quiet during a meeting, was really profound.

Reama Dagasan: And as I now work remote from my team three weeks out of the month, her lessons are something that I use day to day, to work effectively with the people that I work with.

That’s really cool. Of course, I think I told you this when we were first starting the podcast, my dream was to have two people on that got me started and interested in this. And that was Mary and Tom Poppendieck who are the authors of Lean Software Development.

Bill Raymond: Of course, I come from a technology background and I am a consultant, helping organizations run projects, and I also help organizations do Agile transformation. And one of the things that helped me clarify, especially when I was working on a really large technical project was this book, Lean Software Development. And I was so excited when you were able to get them onto the podcast. And so I,still to this day, appreciate your work to do that.

A diverse guest list

Reama Dagasan: My pleasure, you know, I am very excited about our guest list, and so it’s been very exciting to have a lot of women that are in technology on the show, to show that we are all out here and we’re all running our companies successfully and playing really valuable roles, and either doing Agile, sort of by the book and you know, having sprints and retrospectives and following this framework really firmly and religiously, or just kind of touching on Agile, but using it to make things better.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, absolutely. I think if you just scroll through the AgileinAction.com podcast, you could see, we have a very diverse list of guests. And I absolutely adore that we have that. And I do give the praise to you for having made sure that that happens.

Reama Dagasan: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I mean, the world is, we’re at what, 7 billion people, and we’re all very different, but we all have a lot that we can add. And so it’s just up to us to go find those voices that have a fresh and exciting new message to share with us and with our listeners.

Bill Raymond: Absolutely. Reama, I’m so glad that you were able to take the time to share your own personal experience and how you use Agile in your own life.

Bill Raymond: Plus also, celebrate this two-year anniversary in this special edition of the podcast. I really appreciate your time today.

Reama Dagasan: Yeah, thank you for having me on and thank you for letting me be a part of this podcast. It’s been interesting both to learn some new technical tricks, you know, I can now produce a podcast, but it’s also been a very exciting way to learn something new each week.

Bill Raymond: If anyone wants to reach out to you, how might they do that?

Reama Dagasan: So you are welcome to reach me via the contact link on the website. It’s reama.dagasan@cambermast.com. You can connect with me on LinkedIn. And those are really the best ways to reach me. I have a low social media profile, so those are the routes I would suggest.

Bill Raymond: I will make sure that your LinkedIn profile link is on the AgileinAction.com podcast website.

Bill Raymond: And also of course, if you’re in a app right now and you want to reach out to Reama, just go ahead and go to the show notes or the description, and you’ll see that LinkedIn link there as well. Thank you for your time today, Reama.

Reama Dagasan: Thank you, Bill and listeners, I hope that we’ll be hearing from you. We’d love to speak with you. Cheers.</content>

About today’s podcast

Bill Raymond: Hi, this is bill Raymond. I used to lead the software development team in an IT department at a global manufacturing company. This company was well known for providing high quality products to other companies with very high standards.

Bill Raymond: Our previous CFO retired and the new one came on board. This new CFO started asking for things you would probably expect such as master procurement plans, plant efficiency reports, and much more. Unfortunately, the results were frankly a bit of a mess.

Bill Raymond: Each manufacturing plant had a General Manager managing nearly everything, including their own procurement systems, IT staff, and had their own financial teams.

Bill Raymond: When the CFO asked me and my colleagues to visit the corporate office, he had a very straightforward question, which was why the heck – well, he didn’t say heck, so feel free to select from your library of expletives and choice, colorful words, and you will understand the tension in the room – but the message was this: why the heck don’t we as a publicly traded company that has to report financials to the street, have to rely on 300 people with paper, pencils, and adding machines to get the numbers that should be updated daily in front of the CFO on his computer screen?

Bill Raymond: Of course you could go in with a bunch of “that’s how we always did it” excuses, or you could bring solutions. We proposed some groundbreaking stuff and I think at this point, you’ll probably notice that I’m being a little sarcastic, but we proposed a centralized corporate IT division that would standardize our email and network infrastructure, and most importantly, build a centralized financial system.

Bill Raymond: The CFO agreed to this and working with the CEO and his colleagues formalized that corporate CIO role. However, he did not want to wait for us to get started. We immediately began hiring third-party vendors to help us bridge technology gaps while we worked on the more challenging part of implementing a full scale global financial system.

Bill Raymond: Unfortunately, some of those contractors were better than others and of course, some did a great job. But there were others that had important roles where they could not get the software written in a timely manner, they did not understand the scope, and we generally had poor communications with them.

Bill Raymond: As part of that learning, we let a number of companies go. We sat back and created a model for how we would work with outside software development firms. Instead of looking for the fastest people to turn the work around, we looked for more experience. Instead of hiring the most well-known firms, we found the ones that would offer our teams the best cultural fit. With these and other criteria in place, we found some great companies and fairly quickly I noticed we stopped calling them contractors and started calling them business partners.

Bill Raymond: Later I worked with one of those partners and I had the unique opportunity to learn what it was like on the other side. I quickly learned that it is not necessarily the surface you provide, but how you build and maintain trust with your customer. I also learned that as a service provider you often have standards and practices for how you work.

Bill Raymond: However, the customer may have a vastly different way of doing things. We see this in software today where software developers adopt agile practices and methods to deliver their software. But maybe the customer does not. Even small things like terminology and communication styles can be vastly different.

Bill Raymond: Many of you as regular Agile in Action podcast listeners tell me that working with outside service providers can be, shall we say, trickier than you might’ve thought. That is why I asked Dr. Mark Balbes to be a guest on today’s podcast. We’ll get into Mark’s role in just a moment but what I hope you get out of today’s podcast are some practical ways to bridge the gap and build highly effective teams when working with third party service providers.

Bill Raymond: Of course, if you are a service provider, Mark provides invaluable insight into how you can build the best possible relationship with your customers.

Bill Raymond: So with that, let’s get started!

Introductions

Bill Raymond: Hi and welcome to the podcast. Today I’m joined by Mark Balbes senior director of modern software enablement in application services at Worldwide Technology.

Bill Raymond: Hi Mark, how are you today?

Mark Balbes: I’m great. Thanks for asking how are you?

Bill Raymond: I’m doing great. Thank you. We’re going to be talking about quality agile delivery with external stakeholders, but before we get into all of that could you introduce yourself?

Mark Balbes: Yeah. You already stole my name and my title and everything. Balbes Senior Director at Worldwide Technology. So my background, I am a high school dropout. I’m a PhD nuclear physicist. I am a trained salt miner, software developer for many years, and uh, now I have the joy of leading multiple teams at Worldwide Technology across different services related to software development including our agile transformation practice and our software modernization practice.

Bill Raymond: Wonderful. Let’s get into that a little bit. Could you explain what Worldwide Technology is for anyone that doesn’t know them?

Mark Balbes: Yeah we’re a unknown gem for folks that don’t know us. Started out really in the computer networking equipment resell business, where the largest Cisco reseller. So if you’re in, in the business, people know about us, we’re also solution providers. So we have different capabilities around helping folks with digital transformation, with agile transformation, which is part of what I’m doing uh, software development.

Mark Balbes: So all services related to the IT industry. We can, we can help you buy the hardware, install the hardware, configure it, write the software for it, help you find people. So really a lot of different services. It’s really fun to be here, because there’s so much going on.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I absolutely love working with a company that has a diverse set of clients and different types of work that you can do. There’s nothing better than being able to just wake up and see what’s new the next day.

Mark Balbes: It’s fantastic because you’re right. It’s a lot of it is what toys do I get to play with today?

Challenges of working with exterrnal business partners

Bill Raymond: And from that perspective, we’re gonna be talking a little bit about quality agile delivery, but we’re gonna do this in a little bit of a different way. Normally, when we talk about this, we’re talking about how you do it within your organization. And you’re going to talk about that, but there’s another layer of this that I think, as a company that does consulting business and having worked with many in the past.

Bill Raymond: One of the challenges that we’ve always had with agile is we create these great i nternal processes, but then we have these clients, these pesky clients that have their own yeah, that have their own way of doing things and it might still be agile, but it may not be the way we defined it either. So it’s gonna be interesting to talk to you about the differences between the two. But before we get into the external part, let’s talk about the internal part. You said you’re part of an agile transformation effort and you have mentioned that you’ve adopted agile. Can you talk a little bit about that journey and what you have adopted so far the types of things that you’ve done within your own organization at Worldwide Technology?

Mark Balbes: Yeah, absolutely. I’ve been with the organization for about 15 years. So I’ve gotten to see a lot of change going on and that’s one of the interesting things is to look back at how we developed software 15 years ago on the cutting edge of agile. Where we are today and what’s changed and what’s still the same, which is just as important.

Mark Balbes: So like you said, we’re a large part of our business is building applications either for our customers or with our customers. We have our own internal teams that we run in a extremely agile fashion. And I can describe that. But then we also have models of engagement with our customers where we’re co-developing with them, or we’re helping to enable them to develop so helping to teach them better practices around software development, like being more agile or moving to the cloud or any of number of things that we can do to help them.

Mark Balbes: So with, within our own teams we really have embraced strongly the agile manifesto and the principles and originally for probably the first 10 years or so. That was really our guiding light was the agile manifesto that we would go back to. And what we realized was in working for so long with our different customers, different kinds of customers. And I know we’ll get into to the wide variety that we have just within application services. We wanted our own delivery principles, cribbing a lot from the agile manifesto, but focused on what we do. So the manifesto is really meant, it’s very general for software development. You could be applied to a product company, a services company anyone developing software, including us.

Mark Balbes: And we develop software for other people. We don’t have our own products for the most part, we have a couple. But most of what we do is building stuff for our customers. That’s a very specific kind of way of working and we wanted to be more tailored to that. And so we came up with our delivery principles and we have 10 of them. I can rattle them off if you’d like me to and say what they are.

Worldwide Technology’s Agile principles

Bill Raymond: Yeah. Could you share what the principles are that you’ve developed internally?

Mark Balbes: Absolutely.

Mark Balbes: The first one is customer value that our highest priority is to provide value to the customer in alignment with their expectations. So that alignment piece is different from the agile manifesto. It’s not about what we want. It’s about what our customer wants and making sure we’re working together toward that.

Mark Balbes: Embrace change. We embrace changing requirements even late in delivery. So that’s pretty much the same.

Mark Balbes: Deploy often release working software as frequently as the client can tolerate. So that’s different, right? It’s not released as frequently as possible. It’s as frequently as the client can tolerate, we have a customer, the Department of Defense and we build for them what we call the Mobile Field Kit.

Mark Balbes: And you can go out and find videos on the MFK. Every time we do a release of the Mobile Field Kit, it costs them millions and millions of dollars because it’s not just accepting the release. They have to go out and train all of their people on it, which means doing actual exercises with it, going out into the field, deploying and making sure they understand how the new features impact their mission.

Mark Balbes: Testing first of all, does it work the way it’s supposed to, but more importantly, does it improve their operational capability? And releasing more than twice a year, big official releases is really expensive for them. So we release often internally, but they can’t tolerate big releases frequently. So that’s a difference, right? How frequently they can tolerate it, not how frequently can we do it?

Bill Raymond: Yeah. And that’s an interesting one because I’m thinking about an agile team, especially in software development, you’ll see it normally be somewhere between one and three weeks where something gets released and it’s, and we call those sprints usually or iterations. And what you’re saying is you might still work in that fashion, but the customer may not see the, all the effort around that work for some period of time.

Mark Balbes: That’s right. We will still release internally. We still do regular demos every week or every couple of weeks with our customer so they can see our progress. We do everything as frequently as possible up to the point of release at least with the Mobile Field Kit. And of course it depends on the customers and how we’re interacting with them, how far we can go before we have to match their schedule instead of our schedule.

Bill Raymond: Sorry, I interrupted you there. You were on number three, which is deploy as often as a client can tolerate.

Mark Balbes: Yep. Work together. So customers and the delivery team must work together regularly throughout the project delivery.

Mark Balbes: Next one is communicate effectively. So we intentionally choose the most effective ways to communicate with our teams and stakeholders. Different customers respond to communication in different ways, more than just do we email you or do we, text you or something like that, but there’s different formats for how we do status reporting. One of my projects that I’m working with the team now. We pretty much revamped how we do our status meeting with our customer to more closely align to what they want out of that status report versus our standard out of the box status report that we do.

Mark Balbes: Ours is pretty cool. We had our UX team go through it and we did all kinds of usability studies to make sure that, our standard report status reporting was as good as possible and our customers could understand it. You do all that work and you show it to the customer and they’re gonna tell you they want something different and it’s not for us to say, but we did all this work! It’s yeah, okay let’s figure out what’s effective for you.

Mark Balbes: Sustainable pace. So the delivery team’s processes should enable them to maintain a sustainable pace throughout the project delivery cycle .

Mark Balbes: Design or sustainment continuous attention to good design maintainability and sustainment enhances agility and aids, ongoing support.

Mark Balbes: So sustainment is, I think with my experience with agile, it’s one of those things that you have to be really careful about. That you’re thinking about it. We’ve had challenges in the past before we started really paying attention to it that, agile teams can work fast and they can get stuff out the door and it’s really cool. But did anyone think about how do you maintain the system? How do you sustain it going forward for us, how is our customer going to take over that running application and actually keep it running and add to it and keep it a living thing. So we pay very close attention to that.

Mark Balbes: Simplicity. Simplicity, the art of maximizing the amount of work not done is essential. I think that’s word for word from the agile manifesto. It’s so important.

Mark Balbes: Measure and improve continuous measurement and improvement is vital at the individual and team levels. We do a lot with our people around their own professional development and helping them qualitatively and quantitatively know where they’re at with their capabilities, with their careers. We spend a lot of time doing that.

Mark Balbes: So agile tends to be about the team. How fast is the team going? How productive are they? How can we go faster? We do all of that too. That is essential, right? When you’re on a project, you are optimizing the team, not the individual, but there’s still the need from a company perspective to know how your individuals are performing. So we try to not have that be anecdotal. We like it to be a little bit more concrete that gives that person more feedback for them about where they can improve or where they’re doing well. That’s just as important and, lean into the things they’re doing well and get even better and help with the things where they need.

Mark Balbes: And then healthy teamwork, the best outcomes are produced through healthy teamwork. We absolutely believe in that. It is very rare that we have a single person working on something that is, a larger kind of engagement. We’ll always try to get at least a pair of people on it, if not a full team. So those are them.

Bill Raymond: Thank you very much. And that last one was so important. I used to run a software development team at another consulting firm. One of the things that I was always trying to do was just have sort of a developer on a project because we kind of got stretched a little thin usually, and one of the biggest challenges that we had with that, which is interesting was that the team member that was doing the work, were always struggling to find someone that can do the, that can QA the work. And they’re trying to find people they can bounce ideas off of, but there’s, they’re not there on the project. And I was worried about increasing the team to have this sort of multiple people on a client team, because that means more money to the customer.

Bill Raymond: But what I saw was the quality went up very significantly when we staffed a little bit more for the team and sometimes the customer would come back and say Bill, how come your estimate is much higher than these other estimates? And I’ve found that actually not only was it a selling point, but it was a fact that they were going to get a higher quality product when we have that healthy teamwork those teams that can work together just because someone else is paying for the work the people on the other ends that have to do the work, they need to be part of something where they can work with other people and feel comfortable that they’re doing their best.

Mark Balbes: That’s absolutely true. The other thing you have to think about is the total cost of ownership, that when you have that lower quality product, you are gonna be fixing bugs. You are gonna have a harder time maintaining it over time. And so I I’m maybe a little bit nasty when customers ask can we not do pair programming?

Mark Balbes: Can we not do a utomated testing and my response to things like that is, is, yeah we can add some time to not do those things because that’s what happens when you pair program the, they go faster, the quality goes up, which means you get more features in the same amount of time. My observations from doing this for 20 plus years is that you get more when you do the pair programming for your money and especially true when you look at the total cost of ownership.

Mark Balbes: So one, one thing you don’t see with these delivery principles, we don’t have any thou shall do pair programming, thou shall do continuous integration, thou shall, anything. We have our own beliefs in what makes our team successful, but they have a lot of autonomy in how they choose to work. So there are some things that we insist on because we just need them to manage the, our projects effectively and interact with our customer. So I talked about, status reporting, which is a boring thing, but you gotta do it. But our teams get to choose how they work.

Mark Balbes: And if they want to do KanBan process, if they want to do a, a SCRUM process for our internal teams where we’re managing them, that’s really up to them. But for the most part, you are going to see the hardcore pair programming test-driven development, continuous integration, continuous deployment if that’s possible we, will have CI/CD servers up and running. We have all the different kinds of tools to do the collaboration either physically or like a KanBan process.

Mobile Field Kit for the Department of Defense

Mark Balbes: One of the things I talked about Mobile Field Kit, I ran that for almost five years. That’s my kind of my baby. We had 24 linear feet of Kanban on three, eight- foot wide corkboards. Our entire process was mapped out on that. And we had other teams that are using, Trello or JIRA or something like that with big large screen monitors.

Company culture

Mark Balbes: The other thing we believe strongly in is co-location and what we’ve learned is that can be physical or virtual. So especially with COVID we already had what we called our virtual office. And so we didn’t talk about remote people. We talked about people in our virtual office and we treated our virtual office the same as our physical office there’s office managers, there’s policies around the virtual office, there are benefits to being in the virtual office that you wouldn’t necessarily get if you’re in a physical office. So for example, if you’re in a physical office, you would expect to have a desk. Somebody in our virtual office they have, they get a desk, things like that. And so when COVID hit, because we already had this virtual office concept set up and we had teams working effectively in it, we moved, we had a hundred people in the virtual office before COVID and we moved over 500 people into the virtual office in a weekend, and never missed a beat because we all knew how to work together. We already had those virtual tools that everybody was familiar with and yeah, and we just kept going. It was really pretty amazing. How well our agile capabilities helped us with dealing with COVID.

Bill Raymond: If anything comes out of this I’m happy to that we have a success story about COVID. Because those are those, there are, those are some tough times that it sounds like that was handled pretty well. I appreciate that you had already thought through all of that.

Bill Raymond: And I’m sure this is all part of some of your agile transformation work that you’ve been doing as well.

Mark Balbes: Yeah, our customers are dealing with the same thing. And so a lot of our experience up-front, we were able to help our customers do those same things and show them what we’re doing. But back to the topic at hand. We can’t assume that what works for us is gonna work for our customers. And so we can help, but we also have to adapt to their requirements.

Understanding your customer’s culture

Bill Raymond: When you talk about adapting to the customer and their environments, what are some of the challenges you see across industry? And I think you told me prior to this call that there’s a pretty wide variety of work that you do as well.

Mark Balbes: Yes. So I already talked about the Mobile Field Kit, which is one of the things we do for the Department of Defense. We have others. We build products for the quick service restaurant industry, fast food places. A lot of the pizza, mobile apps, if you’re using them, came from us and other companies like that that had to adapt very quickly to pick up delivery services, things like that.

Mark Balbes: When you’re dealing with the military, It is very different from dealing with quick service restaurants commercial customers. We do a lot with the banking industry where it’s heavily regulated and they tend to move slower. They can’t absorb changes fast.

Mark Balbes: There are You know, parts of those customers, they have divisions that are responsible for making sure that they’re maintaining their compliance. So they’re very resistant to any change and you have to be able to I won’t say overcome that resistance, but adapt to the resistance maybe is a better term.

Mark Balbes: You have to show them that they can still meet their requirements to make sure that the, the bank is meeting all of its obligations, because if they don’t, there could be huge financial penalties to those banks. And they’re also dealing with as they grow and these, the banks have consolidated over the last 20 years or so. They have different systems that work in different ways that have all been integrated together. So a lot of it is held together with these different integrations that you have to really understand the details of to know what’s going on and making changes to them is fraught with fear that you’re gonna think you’re making something better and you’re going to lose something in, a business rule or something in the process.

Mark Balbes: So banks can be really challenging to help them become more agile or even just in general, working with them on their software. It’s fun. It’s important. But it’s a different challenge from helping a a fast food chain, get their latest mobile app out and delight their customers. So those are some of the industries.

Bill Raymond: You’re stating very clearly that your objective is to do what the customer wants.

Bill Raymond: But there are things, as you said, you have some basic principles and standards that you use internally. So what happens when that gets shaken up? How do you address that?

Mark Balbes: Carefully. So there’s different ways of addressing it. One of the most important things when we’re working with a new customer is establishing trust. The faster, the more we can establish trust with the customer, the more we can do with them.

Mark Balbes: Occasionally we get a customer who’s we just met you. Great. Here’s a boatload of money. Let’s start up, a big team or five teams and let’s go! I wish they were all that way. But they’re not. And so typically when we’re working with customers initially the best thing we find is to start with some kind of a small engagement. Even though we could do something big and flashy and, fantastic for them.

Mark Balbes: Doing that successfully, without first doing something small means you’re risking that you don’t understand the culture, that you’re gonna have a mismatch, more opportunity for clashing with a part of their company that maybe we don’t even know exists until we hit that clash. And so finding something that that they’re excited about, but that’s small either building a capability for them or helping them to to build something for themselves and improve. And so a common engagement for us, initial engagement is what we call a subject matter expert engagement. Let’s take one of our, you know, senior people uh, with a lot of experience in the area that, that, that customer, you know, is in the domain they’re in banking, your fast food or whatever, and just have them go in and spend time with the customer, learning their environment, helping them understand where they can be better. What’s really important is helping them get some quick wins. It’s not about going in and assessing the customer and giving them a report card and telling ‘em, here’s all the things you’re doing wrong.

Mark Balbes: Because that, that doesn’t go over well. It’s about going in and saying, hey if we make this tweak to what you’re doing, you know, we’re gonna get some improvement. Let me do that for you. Let’s do that together and get that improvement. And that’s how a lot of our big work started was just do something small. But that’s, impactful.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, that’s interesting. I think, when we take a look at a lot of the agile frameworks out there. Almost all of them mentioned something along the lines of an MVP or an early win or, something that shows the value in what you’re doing. And that’s, it sounds like you’ve really embraced that idea.

Mark Balbes: It’s understanding what the customer wants too because some customers are, yes, please come in and help us get better. That’s what we want. And other customers don’t want that at all. They’re like, we, we think we have good processes. We know how we work. We need help with this technical problem, help us solve this technical thing or this business thing. And then we know to stay away from any kind of, process improvement or agile kind of talk with them, if that’s not what they’re already doing.

Bill Raymond: Have you encountered situations where the environment on the customer side is vastly different?

Bill Raymond: Maybe they’re using what we like to term, a waterfall method. Where everything gets planned up front. And there’s a schedule that we call a Gantt chart that shows every last task. Have you encountered those situations in these software development efforts?

Mark Balbes: Absolutely. A lot of times, it depends on the industry. So we’ve talked about the banking industry. They tend to be more conservative. They tend to be less agile in how they work. They want to know upfront how things are gonna work and whatnot. So the important thing is to recognize that agile i s not a methodology, right? It’s not SCRUM, it’s not Extreme Programming, it’s not SAFe. Agile is about the principles and the manifesto, so when you’re dealing with a customer who says, look, I’ve gotta have a high level design before you start working. Then, you know what? That is a requirement that is coming from the customer and you deal with that the way that you would deal with it in an agile process, there’s a requirement.

Mark Balbes: We’ll put the card on the board for the requirement and we’ll do that requirement. Now we’re going to recognize that doing some kind of high level design there’s a point of diminishing returns just from our experience, not just as being Agileists, but just expert software developers with all of our experience.

Mark Balbes: And so we will try to do the minimum necessary to satisfy the customer requirement. Obviously trying to make it as right, as possible, but then we’ll also want to prove out the design by doing some work. And so that’s where we can coach the customer about somebody like that is who’s asking for those designs.

Mark Balbes: What they’re trying to do is mitigate risk. It’s I wanna know that you guys know what you’re doing so that when you start building it, we’ve already thought through all the problems and we figured out what they are and how we’re gonna solve ‘em and we know that’s not true. You’re never gonna be able to do that.

Mark Balbes: Talking to the customer in their own language, talking to them about risk. We’ve got this high level design, let’s start working on an MVP or a prototype, whatever words resonate with them and prove out that design before we get too far. Guess what? Now you’re on the agile path of delivering something early and you give them that flavor for it and you can hopefully keep going in that direction.

Different working styles

Bill Raymond: When we talk about agile, is that teams. Should be as close to the customer as possible. Now, in this case, of course, the customers come to you and they’ve said we want to do this work. So that’s great. You’re gonna have that, that communication there, but the actual customer, the person or people using it, they might be somewhat separated from the team that you’re working on. How do you address that situation or do you make it a requirement that you are able to talk to these customers? What’s what are some of the methods that you use to make sure that you aren’t just following the words a, let’s say a, a small group assigned to work with you are saying versus the people that will use the product at the end?

Mark Balbes: Yeah. So first of all, I was on a project once that was building a medical application for a physician’s office. And the development team sat in a physician’s office. They gave us a conference room and that’s where we were doing the work. When. To talk about close that’s pretty close.

Mark Balbes: It’s a tough problem and so for us, ourselves, we have a product ownership team, we Have a user experience team that we can leverage for our engagement. So we are all in on wanting to be as close to the customer as possible, the user of the system to really understand how they’re thinking about it, how they want to use it and give a better experience than initially might have been thought possible. There are times when the client will say, we already know what we need for our customers, we don’t need to go to them. And that can be a problem because they’re stopping us from talking directly with the users of the apps. We’re giving demos to people who themselves aren’t getting the feedback that we would want from the right people. It’s a tough challenge because we have to maintain the relationship with our clients and they are, I’m not gonna say that they’re always right. But we have to make sure that they don’t feel like we’re going around them or undermining them or anything like that.

Mark Balbes: So we will try to work with them, suggesting, hey, how about if we go into the field and test this with real users or some mechanism to get that feedback, because invariably, when you do that, you find out that those people who think they know and are representing the customer don’t really know. And I’ve learned that from experience enough times.

Mark Balbes: So Mobile Field Kit coming back to that, my baby. One of my roles was basically acting as product owner on it, coming up with the features, driving the team to, build those features. And we were lucky that we got to go into the field, and actually train them on the system and see them using it in exercises. And it was amazing how many times little features that we threw in became like the star of the show and to us it was like, oh, this is just some small thing, we’re putting it in. And it becomes like, oh, this is the breakout thing that they want more of and more of. And if we had been left to our own devices, we would’ve thrown it in and never thought about it again, instead of it becoming now a big feature that we started building on. But once the users interact with the system it changes how they think about their role. So you can’t just take a snapshot in time and say, I know what my users want, because once you start giving them new tools, they start thinking about new ways of doing their job and wanting different features around that.

Bill Raymond: That’s a great story. It’s amazing. The little things that you find out that are so important like for example, I think accessibility is another one. Sometimes people have a hard time seeing the size of the font, but the people on the team, they didn’t have any problem with that. I know that’s becoming more and more of a problem for me.

Mark Balbes: With mobile devices you develop in the office, everything looks great. You walk outside, the sun is, shining down on the screen and you can’t see anything because it’s not a high contrast screen. And if you don’t ever walk outside and actually look at, where are your users actually using the application and see it in that environment, there’s things that you don’t realize you do an app for a, a manufacturing company and everything is great.

Mark Balbes: And then you go and you see it in the field and you realize that everybody’s got noise cancellation on their, headphones on their head and because it’s, so everything is so loud. And so all these great dings and beeps that you built into the system to let them know what’s going on. Nobody can hear those things.

Bill Raymond: Do you run into situations where you have the teams on your side developing the product. And then you also have another agile team on the other side that are also doing work on the same effort?

Mark Balbes: We have different models of engagement. The one that we’ve been talking about really are our internal teams, right? That’s the kind of perfect thing. We have our own processes, our own people. We can control a lot of things to be as effective as possible for our customers.

Mark Balbes: But there are other models of engagement where it may be that, we’re building a mobile app for our customer, but the customer has their own backend team building the services that our mobile app is calling into. In which case you’re coordinating with that team. So that’s one model. There’s a a model where we’re actually co-developing with the customer.

Mark Balbes: So it’s not just our people on the team. It’s our people with the customer’s people. And that can take different flavors because if the customer is interested in learning, having their people learn from us. We’ll actually be able to more closely follow our processes and have their people learn our processes so they can bring them back.

Mark Balbes: But sometimes it’s the other way. Sometimes the customer is basically we have our processes. There’s reasons that we do it this way because of our industry. It’s regulated it, whatever. In which case we have to adapt to how they are working, and that takes flexibility on our people’s part, because at that point they’re going from a very comfortable situation where they have a lot of autonomy and control to one where they’re working more, maybe more traditionally than we like to work, but that’s what’s needed.

Mark Balbes: The desire is that you use that to build trust with the customer, and they start to understand how we work and how we think about things and they trust us so that we can move them closer to a more agile model. Now, sometimes we work with a customer, we learn from them, right? The best thing is, situations like that, you go into with an open mind because, golly gee wouldn’t it be great to go in and discover they’re doing things that we didn’t know about. And that happens too.

Bill Raymond: Those are great moments. I will say there’s so many times when you’re in a situation where, you have some process that you thought was ideal and then the customer comes back and says, oh no look, this is an easier, better way. And you say, yeah, it is!

Mark Balbes: Yeah, we know our processes are as ideal as we’ve learned to make them for us. We are adapted to our kind of work when we do our internal stuff and we’ve learned that we have to be adaptable to our customers and their situation.

Bill Raymond: Yeah. And also, with that experience, that’s why people like to bring you on board I’m sure because they know that you have this wealth of background in different areas. So you bring some best practices that they might be interested in and then they’re gonna bring you some best practices that not only can you use with them, but you can start sharing those as long as they’re not under NDA, it start sharing those with other customers and they get value out of it.

Mark Balbes: Oh, absolutely. I can point to certain things that we do and it’s this is from that customer. And this is from that customer. It’s yeah, those are awesome. When that happens.

Wrap up

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I love those little moments, Mark Balbes, this is a great conversation. I really appreciate your time today. If anyone wants to reach out to you, how might they do that?

Mark Balbes: Oh, that can reach me at uh, LinkedIn. I’m the only Mark Balbes in the world. So it’ll be me.

Mark Balbes: I write a, a column. I say it’s monthly. But there’s some gaps for application development trends magazine called the agile architect.

Bill Raymond: Great. Yeah. And that’s how we found you. And they’re great articles. I really suggest that you go and check those out as well. Of course, your LinkedIn profile and the agile architect link will be in the agileinaction.com website. And of course, if you’re using a podcast app right now, listening to this podcast, just scroll down to the show notes to the description and you’ll see the links there as well.

Bill Raymond: Mark Balbes, once again, thank you very much for your time today.

Welcome to the podcast

-–

Bill Raymond: Hi and welcome to the podcast. Today, I’m joined by Lyssa Adkins, author of "Coaching Agile Teams," and an agile and leadership coach.

Introductions

-–

Bill Raymond: Hi, Lisa, how are you today?

Lyssa Adkins: Hi, I’m doing great. Thank you for the invitation and for this conversation, who knows where it’s going to go?

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I’m looking forward to it. We’re going to talk about how leaders create the space for agile to flourish today. But before we get started, could you introduce yourself?

Lyssa Adkins: Sure. I’m probably most well known for my work for over a decade in helping emerge the profession of agile coaching, and the discipline of agile coaching. And recently, I’ve been shifting my focus to where the greatest pain point is, which is leadership, leaders individually, and then collectively as leadership teams, and the shifts that they are being asked to make to be more of a match for this, you know, sort of confounding and volatile era that we’re in, and how that’s related to agile and just modern ways of working in general.

Bill Raymond: When we talk about agile transformation, very often, we just talk about a product team or a software team or IT.

How can leaders start to think differently?

-–

Bill Raymond: But it is expanding throughout the organization, and there is a different mindset that we have as a agile team and sometimes we expect leaders to act differently as well, and to understand what that means.

Bill Raymond: So could you maybe at a very high level to get started, talk about what that means from the context of this conversation we’re having today?

Lyssa Adkins: Yeah, I think what it means is that we start putting ourselves in the worldview in the context of what leaders care about. You know, we agileists for a long time have been you know, working at the team, the portfolio, the product level, you know, up to sort of director, senior, vice president sort of level in organizations pretty regularly.

But we haven’t really entered their world yet. And that’s what I have been attempting to do for the last several years, is enter their world and say, so, you know, if one of the goals is to deliver better and to deal with the constant change that’s happening through agile, if that’s one of the goals, then what’s the daily context that leaders care about that would have them clear the way for those goals to happen, for agile to flourish in their organization, and for them to be able to deal with the complex confounding world we’re in a little bit better?

Agile and Non-agile Team Differences

-–

Bill Raymond: We talk about this very frequently, what agile means, but could you share what an agile team looks like and what some of their focus is that might be different from if you will, maybe a non-agile team, and the differences between what they might expect from their leaders?

What is an Agile Team?

-–

Lyssa Adkins: Sure. So an agile team is one that is going to be in constant direct conversation and collaboration with the business people that want the thing they’re creating. An agile team is going to be delivering a piece of that actual business value on a regular cadence, let’s say every two weeks. They will be able to have real customers inspect that delivery of value, so that you can change when it’s cheap and you can adapt and actually build the thing the customer wants, rather than the thing we sort of imagined they wanted. And an agile team will be expecting to have no wait time, not waiting for things they need to come into the team and not waiting for the product that they make to hit the customer. That should just flow very, very smoothly.

Lyssa Adkins: So agile teams are going to expect that leaders are there to sort of take the ball of a big organizational impediment, that they will throw a leaders’ way.

Lyssa Adkins: Because one of the things that agile does, well, I often say this sort of tongue-in-cheek is that, you know, the only thing agile is guaranteed to deliver a hundred percent of the time are impediments. You know, and impediments are those things that make it so this team that has a charge to do something important for a customer doesn’t get stopped by the sort of the regular big machine sort of mechanical processes we’ve set up from the last century, that are still very much alive in many modern organizations.

Lyssa Adkins: So they’re going to expect leaders to number one, essentially, let them make a lot of decisions and stay out of the way of their value creation. Number two, come into the process at specific times, and there are specific times for leaders to do that, to give significant feedback, to make sure that the product is exactly hitting what we want in the marketplace.

Lyssa Adkins: And then number three, be Johnny-on-the-spot, like right there, to help clear those organizational impediments when they arise.

Lyssa Adkins: That’s the agile team and what they would sort of expect from leaders.

What is a Non-agile Team?

-–

Lyssa Adkins: A non-agile team is going to be a lot more passive. A non-agile team is essentially going to, you know, maybe the team members don’t work together in a concentrated block of time every day. Maybe they’re not directly connected to the business people, who are directly connected to the customers. You know, maybe they’re just sort of waiting to do their piece and hand it off to the next person. So you can already feel like even in the way of describing that, like how much more waiting there is, how much we’re used to making, as my husband likes to say, making a plan for a plan for a phase gate review, you how much we’re used to raising something that’s right in our way, we can’t do our work, but yet we know it’s not going to get addressed anytime soon, so we just sort of fill the time with other things. And there’s a lot of that sort of inefficiency that goes on in organizations, and is it most of the time, hidden by a veneer of busyness. So most leaders don’t know what’s even happening.

Project Management in Agile is Very Different

-–

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I can see that for sure. And, you know, I can tell you one of my aha moments in my personal career. You know, I’ve been in the project management business for a very long time, and as a project manager, my role was to be the intermediary between the project team and the sponsor. And very often it was a sponsor that made the decisions.

Bill Raymond: So I, as a leader in the project team, as a project manager, people would come to me and say, can I do this? We think we need that. The customer said they want this change. I have to go back and talk to the sponsor. And then the sponsor would say, I don’t like that idea, I do like this idea and we got sign off on each and every one of those things, and I bring it back to the team, sometimes the team was unhappy.

Bill Raymond: But when I moved into the agile world, frankly, the project manager’s role is very different. As a matter of fact, it’s kind of like hands off the agile team, and those agile teams are talking to the customers, as you said, and they’re saying, oh, the customer just told us that this isn’t going to work for them, so we are shifting on a dime and making a change, and there’s no, if you will, big project plan either.

Bill Raymond: And while the leader might have some say in what the team does, they’re usually not the ones making the decisions. it’s these agile teams that are doing that because they’re the ones that are closest to where the customer is.

Bill Raymond: So that was my big aha moment.

Agile is a Very Disorienting World

-–

Lyssa Adkins: Well, I mean, I think it’s an amazing aha you’re having there. The thing I want to highlight about it is that agile is a very disorienting world. The agile way of working much better matches this volatile and uncertain time we’re in that’s actually, frankly, not projected to get any better anytime soon.

Lyssa Adkins: In fact, you know, maybe even change is going to be on a even more steep exponential curve, right? So agile works beautifully with it, but you see how disorienting the two things are. Like you talked about not like a baby step forward from one to the next, you talked about two completely different worlds.

Lyssa Adkins: And I think that the thing I would add to this is, I recently was asked to do a keynote, and it was for leaders of supply organizations to a big multinational corporation. And they wanted to know, OK, it sounds like agile just lets us change all the time and that doesn’t feel very safe. So how can we react and work with all these changes that are happening and still sort of have some semblance of where we’re going, and still sort of have some way of knowing that it’s going to turn out OK. And there’s two things I want to pull apart here. Number one, no one will guarantee that anything is going to turn out OK. And I think if leaders are looking for that, that’s the thing they’re going to have to start doing, their own inner work on to deal with the fact that we’re in an era where everything’s falling away, everything you counted on is falling away. So that’s a bit, no one’s going to guarantee it’s going to be OK.

There are Safety Harnesses Built Into Agile

-–

Lyssa Adkins: However, there is safety in metabolizing all of these changes using the agile practices, principles, and values. That agile actually creates safety for us to do that. And while everything else is falling away, while you can’t guarantee that the next change that’s going to rock your whole organization, you can’t guarantee how that’s going to happen or what that’s going to do, you can build safety in using the agile pieces to metabolize that change, and no matter what the change is, get something good out of it.

Lyssa Adkins: There are these safety harnesses built in to the way agile works. And I think what happens is that unfortunately, when agile comes into a lot of large organizations, those safety harnesses get taken out, right? And so this is like, I just really want to impress upon people, if you do the agile frameworks as intended, you’ve got the safety for adapting to change built in.

Bill Raymond: So far, what you shared was that there needs to be a shift in mindset. And we’ve also talked a little bit about the fact that the leaders will trust their teams to be working with the customers on a regular basis, and that they will be focused on delivering what those customer needs are.

Bill Raymond: So there’s maybe a little less, if you will, if we do that comparison between the old and the new way, there’s sort of a new level of trust that happens between the leaders and the teams. And there’s a lot of this concept of, you know, solving problems, closing impediments, I think is actually the words you used, and fixing those issues.

Strategic Perspective for a Leader

-–

Bill Raymond: But, what about from the strategic perspective? Because of course, I could imagine, you know, as a leader that’s something that I struggle with on a regular basis. What am I leaving the teams to do versus how do I think about moving the company forward?

Bill Raymond: Could you talk a little bit about that?

Lyssa Adkins: Well, so far, I think our conversation is talking about teams that deliver value inside of organizations, sort of maybe the one or two levels of leaders above that.

Lyssa Adkins: I think there’s a lot for those leaders. I think those leaders that are in direct contact with teams, there’s certified agile leadership courses, there’s all kinds of things that help them understand how to use agile to their advantage. Who I’m really interested in, are the executive leaders of an organization that by and large, are not that involved with teams on a daily basis.

Lyssa Adkins: And yet what happens in organizations, is as agile continues to proliferate, as we start to get some good return from using it, then at some point it hits this glass ceiling in an organization. And that glass ceiling is usually the top leadership team, because that top leadership team is behaving in a frame of reference that is completely different than the rest of the organization now.

Lyssa Adkins: And the rest of the organization will absolutely be stopped by the level of consciousness and mental complexity of that top team. that’s where I think like the biggest bottleneck for using agile well is right now.

Mental Complexities of the Leadership Team

-–

Bill Raymond: Yeah, so could you talk a little bit about what those complexities are?

Lyssa Adkins: Yeah, obviously, different for every leadership team and every leader, but as a general idea, what top leadership teams are faced with now, is that the way they have coped and the way they have thrived up to this point, no longer holds.

Lyssa Adkins: And if individuals think it does hold, after one or two conversations, they could start to say like, oh yeah, now that you’re asking me questions, Lyssa, I’m actually letting in how volatile and uncertain things are. I get how it doesn’t really hold anymore.

Lyssa Adkins: And so these top leaders come to sort of the same realization honestly, that agile teams come to, which is that we cannot control any of this, that the empirical process is our best hope. And for leaders even more is at stake. So much is at stake because of the way we’ve organized our economic activity, the way the stock market expects certain things.

I have such compassion for leaders who understand that their way of leading is not working as well as it used to. And yet at the same time, they’re up against the same sort of demands and stresses that they have been up against for a long time. Yet it doesn’t seem to be working well anymore.

The Inside Job

-–

Lyssa Adkins: This is where the job becomes an inside job, you know, inside of each leader, and then more importantly, collectively with how that leadership team functions. So let’s just start with inside every leader first.

Lyssa Adkins: The inside job is to radically expand one’s mental complexity, to become a match for the complexity of the problems and situations we’re in on a daily basis in business these days.

Lyssa Adkins: And so what that means practically, let’s just take an example of like, well, there’s so many supply chain failures right now, so let’s just take a supply chain failure example. That’s pretty common, right?

Lyssa Adkins: So as a supply chain failure, you can’t get a key component that you need to make your product. The way we handle that right now, as leaders and as a leadership team, is we just sort of pile on the pressure. We’re like, make it happen, you know, we go into like massive overworked firefighting mode and we just continue to force. And that is one way of dealing with it, and maybe a useful way in a short term situation. But if we’re going to be encountering those sorts of failures over and over and over again, then it might be worth taking the time and looking at it from lots of different perspectives.

Lyssa Adkins: And so one of the most disorienting questions for leaders that is really useful to them is something like, what are these supply chain failures trying to tell you? Questions like, what is trying to happen here? If you were to take the perspective of your supplier, what would you see? If you were to take the perspective of the relationship system that your organization and all of your suppliers are in, what’s happening there that might be clues?

Lyssa Adkins: These are ways to expand one’s range of possibilities to create new points of view. I realize this is still sounding so abstract, because it’s just so different for each leader in each leadership team, but there is absolutely this beautiful instrument that helps leaders see what their leadership impact actually is, compared to what they think it is.

-–

Lyssa Adkins: And it helps them move from this sort of predict-and-plan mentality that used to work, you know, quite a bit better, to a more sense-and-respond mentality, which is exceptionally uncomfortable. I’m telling you, I’m in it every day myself, it’s super uncomfortable, but it’s more of a match for the volatility.

Keeping Yourself Thinking Differently

-–

Bill Raymond: As a leader, there’s this expectation that things are moving forward and you have excellent communication with your teams. So when a big change happens, like suddenly the supplier. I can’t deliver as promised. One of the things that might happen and go through your head is I already made commitments based on what the supplier committed.

Bill Raymond: And I already made commitments because my team said that we can make these dates. And now there’s a sense that you have to do something about it. And I think that puts you into this fight or flight mode.

Bill Raymond: Now you have to start pushing to get things back on track. And what you’re saying is, well, yes, sometimes you do just have to push. You have to push hard.

Bill Raymond: As you said, sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn’t. But here’s the big problem is if you start to go down that path, it’s hard to step back and think differently.

Bill Raymond: Do you have any ideas, concepts, approaches that someone might take as a leader to think differently about the challenge at hand?

Lyssa Adkins: Yeah, I sure can, and I want to start by challenging the notion that it all worked before.

Lyssa Adkins: Because it didn’t. So you and I are long time project managers, we know what happens, we know what happens. You know, things do not go according to plan, even when we were in a simpler world where change was not exponential, things did not go according to plan at all, but we sort of drove the system to just deal with it somehow. And so by the time information gets to an executive leader, they don’t necessarily see the duck going like crazy with the little feet under the water. They see something that looks smooth. It never was, it never was.

Lyssa Adkins: And so this idea that we can hold back the tide by holding back change and holding back reality has always been sort of like a veneer that we put on top of what was really going on. So that’s the first thing to challenge, is the notion that it actually did work before. And if it did work before, on whose back did it work?

Lyssa Adkins: So that’s like an interesting question to look at. And given that the pace of change is now exponential, that change is pervasive and perpetual, I love that new definition from Aneel Chima and Ron Guttman. They have a Harvard business review article that just captured my attention.

Lyssa Adkins: They said, Look, change itself is different now. We are in an era where change is pervasive, meaning it’s happening in multiple parts of your organization, multiple parts of your own life simultaneously. It’s perpetual, meaning we don’t get the rest between big changes anymore like we used to. We don’t get the sort of, Oh, it’s a big change, OK, we get to rest for a little bit and integrate that. It’s like change after change after change, we don’t get to get off the change bus, in other words. We’re on the ride.

Lyssa Adkins: And the third is, that change is exponential. The actual pace of change itself is increasing.

So given those conditions, a really useful thing for a leader to do is to allow themselves to feel the pain of it. So just imagine how many executive leaders don’t want to go here, and just imagine how useful it would be if more of them did.

Lyssa Adkins: And so this is the work I do, is I help executive leaders actually face the pain of trying to continue to apply things that used to work better, and they’re just doing it a little bit harder, and maybe a little bit harder now, maybe with a little bit more force, and yet things are still falling away.

Techniques to Help with Change

-–

Bill Raymond: And so what are some of the techniques that you use to help with that?

Lyssa Adkins: Well, I think one of the biggest things that’s useful for leaders is to get some objective data about how their leadership is impacting the people in their organization, how it’s impacting their organization’s goals and targets, and how it’s impacting them. And so for that, I use just, I think it’s a really fantastic instrument called, The Leadership Circle Profile. It shows you in no uncertain terms the gap between your self perception of your leadership and the perception of everyone else that you interact with. And the leaders who get the most out of this ask their customers and suppliers to also be part of the 360 evaluation. So that’s one thing, it’s like, get some objective data, have a way to create a pathway for yourself.

Lyssa Adkins: Because otherwise, you’re just sort of swimming in this notion that, oh yeah, we’re being asked to be agile leaders, we’re being asked to be 21st century leaders, what the heck does that mean? And what it means practically to a leader, at the director level and below, is really different than what it means practically to an executive leader. Because an executive leader is dealing with things in a totally different, you know, just a different scale all the time, right?

Lyssa Adkins: Once you have that sort of language, that model, that pathway, it can create, then some really interesting coaching can happen around the leader’s actual issues. So leaders will come with an issue of like, here’s what’s happening in the market, here’s the change that’s happened, you know, here’s what I’m trying to do about it.

Lyssa Adkins: When we do coaching around those sorts of topics, it’s not just general. It’s now referring back to what the leader is already getting in touch with related to their own leadership and how they react to things like that, versus how they create outcomes.

Lyssa Adkins: That’s one of the big shifts that this leadership circle profile helps people do. It’s called, moving from problem-reacting to outcome-creating.

Being Outcome-driven from an Agile Perspective

-–

Bill Raymond: Can you talk a little bit about outcomes. This is a conversation that I think we have fairly frequently on the podcast, but very often when we’re talking about this outcome-driven mindset, we’re usually talking at a team level. And I am curious to maybe pick your brain around what that means when you’re at an executive leadership level, what does it mean to be outcome-driven?

Bill Raymond: Because I think we can all say, yeah, I’m outcome-driven, of course, I mean, my sales numbers are tied to that or, you know, my bonus is tied to that. What does this look like from an agile perspective?

Lyssa Adkins: So of course, a leader has organizational outcomes they’re going for. And in every specific instance, every specific issue or problem they’re dealing with, there’s always the opportunity to, instead of being run by sort of the problem-reacting mode, which in essence is a mode to reduce our own anxiety, although most of us,even in executive leadership now we’re still run by that kind of mode.

Lyssa Adkins: Instead of being run by that mode, there’s a possibility to stop and say, OK, this is a really difficult confounding situation. Let me ask myself some questions or maybe let me get someone else to help ask me these questions. Questions like, in this specific situation, what am I committed to creating? In this specific situation, what is the higher good that’s trying to happen? Now, the reason you would ask yourself questions like that, is because you’re trying to open up more possibilities for working with the change and the turbulence that’s happening.

Lyssa Adkins: When a leader asks themselves or a peer or a coach asks the leader, so what is the outcome you’re committed to creating here? They might say something like, I need to create more leaders in my organization. Because we don’t have enough people who are just able to run with the ball. OK. They might say, I need to create a better capacity for working with supply chain interruptions, and I’m noticing that that might mean the expansion or the creation of something new in the organization, right?

Lyssa Adkins: So their concerns become much more of like, if they look out across their organization, sort of like a lab scientist, like a scientist in their lab might look across their organization. It’s like, so what’s a little piece that needs to be tuned here, what’s the missing piece there, what’s, you know, those sorts of things are really useful for an executive leader to focus on. Many executive leaders focus on solving the problem of the day. And that’s going to continue to just keep us in the loop of firefighting, making the machine work at all costs, you know, and we’re finding out that employees are no longer willing to be that cost, so that’s even falling away. The idea of becoming outcome-creating is well, it’s whatever it means to an individual leader in a given situation.

Lyssa Adkins: But the more leaders work with this, the more they start to look at building capacity and capability in their organization, more than hitting a thing.

Bill Raymond: It’s maybe at a larger scale, but it still is very similar to the way we talk about this with teams. For example, I know that one of the biggest challenges that agile teams have, doesn’t matter what part of the organization they’re in, marketing, sales, software development, doesn’t matter, you know, one of the biggest challenges that the teams have, is people come to them and say, do this thing. And what they’re looking for is the value. What is the problem that you’re trying to solve? What’s the value that this is going to provide and start thinking about that more holistically.

Bill Raymond: I liked your examples that you used you have a supply chain problem. That problem means that you’re not going to produce what your customers need and it needs to be solved. So you have a few options. Now, I know my answer would be, well, let’s just find more suppliers. But really, what I need to be thinking about is, how do I have a leadership team that works with me, and tell them that problem that we’re having, this supply issue, and have them come up with some interesting solutions. It might be ultimately what you thought would happen, but they might have some other ideas that you hadn’t come up with.

Lyssa Adkins: That’s another way that this is a parallel process to what agile teams go through, just at a different level of impact, just at a different level of scope. It’s so interesting that when I started working with leadership teams, I had this sort of hypothesis that they would have similar team dynamics issues and similar level of competency in things like conflict and whatnot that delivery teams have. Which is to say, we’re all getting better at it. No one is great at most of these team dynamics things.

The Five Core Competencies

-–

Lyssa Adkins: Well, what I found out was that yes, they have that, and in fact, maybe it’s a little bit less competent than your average delivery team. So one of the things I’ve started to really talk about with leadership teams a lot, just to create sort of like a frame around this, is that you have these goals that you have, these OKRs targets, whatever you call them. The way we achieve these in a leadership team is we have a lot of conversations. We make decisions. We have work sessions, right?

Lyssa Adkins: The way those work sessions, decisions and conversations happen, is through five core competencies that every team has to have: collaboration, creativity, conflict, change, and choice-making. So five CCs, five core competencies that just remember them easily for me. And then further than that, what’s really underneath all of that, is the web of relationships and the health or the lack of health of that leadership team’s relationship system, such that they can build those competencies.

Lyssa Adkins: So if we can increase the literal level of competence in those things, then decisions happen easier and they stick longer. Then we can move through work sessions easily without a lot of drag of, you know, poor conversation dynamics. Then as you just said, team members can bring creative ideas to the problem we’re trying to face. We can all be asking ourselves, what are we committed to creating here? Not just, how do we solve this problem, right?

Lyssa Adkins: And then of course, the lift happens through all of these things and then targets and OKRs and all those things get met easier and get trued up to reality more often.

Lyssa Adkins: And I think that’s a key piece of it as well. We start to let reality in more often.

Bill Raymond: I really appreciate your time today, Lyssa. This has been a great conversation. If anyone wants to reach out to you to talk about this further, how might they do that?

Lyssa Adkins: I suggest visiting my website and using contact us. You can also see the sorts of things I’m up to there. There’s lots of podcasts and interviews and all that sort of stuff. It’s at LyssaAdkins.com, but you have to know how to spell it. It’s L Y S S A A D K I N S .com

Bill Raymond: Thank you for that. And I absolutely will make sure that the link for that gets on the agileinaction.com website. Just look up this conversation with Lyssa Adkins. And of course, if you’re listening to this in a podcast player app right now, just scroll down to the show notes or the description, and you’ll see the link there for LyssaAdkins.com.

Bill Raymond: And you’ll also find the link to her book, which is, "Coaching Agile Teams."

Bill Raymond: Thank you so much for your time today, Lyssa, this was a great conversation.

(transcripts are auto-generated, so please excuse the brevity)

Hi, this is Bill Raymond. It is August 2nd, 2022, and I am excited to make a few announcements. The first and most important announcement is that we have grown to over 10,000 listeners.

Thank you!

I want to thank the team who helps deliver a quality podcast every week. And of course, I want to thank you, our listener. We hope to continue providing you with a podcast that is valuable for your personal career growth and helps people in organizations think differently about how we work and interact with each other.

A big milestone!

Another exciting announcement that I want to share with you is that we are celebrating our two year anniversary this month. I created the Agile in Action with Bill Raymond podcast because the terms agile and agility can mean many things. And many people think that agile is a term used for software development and indeed the roots of that specific term come from that community. When you listen to this podcast, you will almost certainly hear from people in the software community, but you will also hear how agile concepts run across many different disciplines.

You can hear James Plunkett at Citizens Advice. Talk about agile for government policy development.  I have also interviewed Andrea Fryrear, as we talk about agile for marketing, and Loreal Jiles, who shares the benefits of adopting agile techniques in finance organizations. Agile and agility is a movement that continues to build steam in the workplace. Organizations that recognize the value in small teams, building great things are the ones that will benefit the most. And I want to help you understand how that works in practice.

Of course smaller, more autonomous teams are just one component of the change required to implement agility. Teams need to thrive in the workplace, which is why Dr. Tracy Browers shares her ideas on that very same topic. Linda Varrell talks about dealing with ambiguity in the workplace. And just recently Alla Weinberg shares how you can create a place of psychological safety in the workplace.

All our podcasts are free of charge from wherever you get your podcasts. You can even listen to our podcasts on the agileinaction.com website.

Introducing transcripts

Now earlier I mentioned, I have a few big announcements. As if 10,000 viewers and a two year anniversary, weren’t enough, we are excited to announce that we are providing a feature many of you have asked for, and that is transcriptions. Moving forward, when you go to a podcast on the agileinaction.com website, you will see the transcriptions for any new podcasts. And let’s starting with the July 26 , 2022 podcast titled the leaders mindset required for organizational agility and that’s with Dr. Thomas Grisham.

Call for guests

Another announcement is that we are looking for guests that have a passion for organizational change, agility, team development, leadership, and modernization. If you are that person or know someone that is just send me an email at bill.raymond@agileinaction.com.

That’s bill.raymond@agileinaction.com, one word.

Want to support the community?

If you’re interested in being part of our growing community of 10,000 plus listeners and have a product or service that you think our audience will be interested in, use that same email address of bill.Raymond@agileinaction.com.

Finally, I would like to ask you for a favor. If you’re listening to this podcast right now in an app and it’s safe to do so, please rate the podcast with five stars. And if you have the time, write a quick review, those two kind acts help us in growing the community and keeping the podcast going.

So that is it. We now have 10,000 subscribers and are celebrating a two year anniversary and we will be providing transcripts for all future podcasts on the agileinaction.com website.

We are on LinkedIn

Actually there is one more thing. We publish our podcast updates weekly on the Agile in Action with Bill Raymond podcast site on LinkedIn. So if you’re on that platform, you can subscribe and get updates whenever we make an announcement or publish a new podcast.

Thank you again!

So thank you very much. And next week we will be back with another podcast.</content>

Full Transcription

Bill Raymond: Hi and welcome to the podcast. Today, I’m joined by Dr. Thomas Grisham - agilist, consultant, and author. Hi Thomas, how are you today?

Thomas Grisham: Doing fine, Bill. How are you?

Introductions

-–

Bill Raymond: I’m doing great. We’re going to be talking about the mindset required for organizational agility. Before we get into that, could you please share a little bit about yourself?

Thomas Grisham: Sure I’d be happy to. I’m going to share with you what the past four decades have given me the opportunity to learn, and it comes from global endeavors primarily. Consulting and education for 400 or so organizations, ranging from, the United Nations to General Motors in 84 countries, and a whole lot of research to try and figure out what was right and what was wrong with all of what I had experienced.

What is ‘organizational agility’

-–

Bill Raymond: We could talk about agile and agility all day long, and I think everyone has their own definition for that.

Bill Raymond: So maybe what you could share, just to kind of put some context for this conversation, you can share what you mean by organizational agility and what it kind of means to have that mindset. So if we can start there and then we can drill into it a bit more.

Thomas Grisham: Okay. What it means in the 21st century, is that the organization is as flat as possible, you need to be as nimble as possible because change is going to be consistent.

Just look at the world today. The third law of thermodynamics says that any system, including organizations, tends to move in a direction of chaos. And if you look at Ukraine and trying to do business in Russia and trying to do business in the EU, today, any company is going to be challenged by that. Even if you have a perfectly agile organization, you’re going to have to adapt to things that you did not anticipate.

Thomas Grisham: So an agile organization to me, is an organization that is as small as possible, that is as anticipatory as possible, meaning, you need to be aware of politics, finance, economic, technical issues, who’s doing what. You need to have a broader view so that you can see things coming before they happen and maybe make an adjustment to go around them rather than have them stop whatever it is you’re doing.

XLQ

-–

Thomas Grisham: To be able to do that, it requires basically three things, which is, I call it Cross-cultural Leadership, XLQ, which is X for cross-cultural, L for leadership, Q for intelligence.

Thomas Grisham: If you make too many mistakes, you’ll spend all of your time cleaning up while the world has changed four more times and you’re cleaning up the wrong mistakes. There is no perfect fix for this, but the idea is, if you’re flatter and if you’re not overworking your people, they have an opportunity to think and just take a walk and imagine, what might this have to do with people that are my colleagues in other locations and them on me? If the organization is hierarchical, it means that all the communications, the vision and strategy, and all have to trickle down all the way through the organization.

Organizations work horizontally

-–

Thomas Grisham: Organizations don’t work that way. They work horizontally, matrix idea. And so the communications, the functional communications go laterally. The visions and the values go vertically. That doesn’t work. That will not make you agile, it will make you the other thing. And so the three pieces, as I said, are leadership, top to bottom.

Thomas Grisham: Communication and knowledge sharing, so that knowledge is shared quickly. And I don’t mean weekly, I mean daily, across an organization, top to bottom, side to side.

Communication channels

-–

Thomas Grisham: If you think about the old formula, any of you that took the PMP training sessions to get your credential, n x n - 1 is the number of communication modes, if you would. So if you have an organization that let’s say, has 10,000 people in it, n x n - 1, a lot of communication channels out there. If you’re communicating by email, it’s not possible. It’s simply not possible. You cannot send and receive that many, let alone read them.

Thomas Grisham: And so, it requires a level of technology, a comfort with technology from top to bottom, not just the IT guys, that enables you to use the technical resources to reduce the amount of time that people have to spend dealing with communications. Just simple communications.

Thomas Grisham: When I ask people, Bill, around the planet, how many emails do you get a day? For example, one of my friends was a VP in Dubai. I met him in the elevator, bumped into him, As-salamu alaykum, I ask him, how many of these do you get a day?

Thomas Grisham: He says, oh, at 300-400, and this is the president of a company. And I said, what do you do with them? He said, I delete them. So you communicate with these guys. He says, if it’s important, they’ll call me. That’s a fairly crude way to go at this. But the answer to that question that I’ve gotten in dozens and dozens of countries is, most people will get hundreds of emails a day. And then you add in the text messaging on top of that.

Thomas Grisham: So if you just do the math, you can’t cope with it. You can’t do some work, go to some meetings and answer all this stuff in the course of a day. If your world changes daily, by the time you get today’s emails done tomorrow, now you got tomorrow’s emails, so it’s a never-ending cycle of things that shouldn’t be pulling on time people spend, because people’s time is worth a lot.

Thomas Grisham: And so between technology and leadership, the communication and knowledge needs to flow easily through a company. And so for companies like, oh think of the Swedish guys. Their internet company, the challenge they had was that they were having people learning lessons in Kenya that were really important to the overall company and needed to get that information from Kenya to Japan. And the problem was, again, if it goes email up the chain, across, down, by the time they get it, it’s old, it’s stale. Shelf life’s gone.

Thomas Grisham: And so the key to it is, you have to be as fast doing what you do as the speed of changes. That is not designed for 21st-century organization. You can’t do this hierarchically.

Hire people that share your vision and values

-–

Thomas Grisham: I’ve seen enough companies try it, big companies like Lufthansa, and I’ve seen them go at this from four or five different ways with different divisions to see, okay, how can we sort this out? And the problem always comes back to, it’s dependent upon the three things that I mentioned. And for people, the assets, did you hire people that share your vision and your values?

Well, no, because we couldn’t communicate it to the HR guys because they’re in the United States, you know, and that kind of thing.

Thomas Grisham: And so the dilemma here is that these things are all interconnected. You can’t just separate them out and put them in nice little piles. They’re all interconnected.

Change Fatigue

-–

Thomas Grisham: But the idea is, the board of directors and the CEO set the vision and the values. Those shouldn’t change weekly.

Bill Raymond: Mm.

Thomas Grisham: Those need to be in place for at least a year. Should be looking five years out so that people have something to hold onto. Too much change, change fatigue, is a really horrible thing for an agile organization. It’s exactly what you do not want.

Bill Raymond: Mhm.

Thomas Grisham: And so in order to anticipate and to avoid, you have to have some anchor.

Thomas Grisham: The anchor is the vision and the values. They can adjust, but they shouldn’t change. And that’s usually five years, then it percolates down to the CEO, the C-suite people, etcetera, etcetera, depending on how the organization is structured.

Thomas Grisham: Think about it this way. Let’s say you’re the CEO of a company, and you’ve just realized that the United States government has issued a sanction on the products that you sell to Russia. And it’s going to go in effect next Tuesday. And imagine that you’ve got some product in, you know, being shipped some project in design, some in manufacturing, scattered all over the chain. If you’re a global company, you may be manufacturing in seven other countries. So you got all this mess out there going on and you realize, uhoh, government just changed the rules.

Flexibility of hierarchical organizations

-–

Thomas Grisham: Okay. How many people need to know this? Let’s imagine it’s hundreds, just for sake of discussion. Okay. So you’re the CEO, you just got word of this from your lobbyist in Washington, and you need to get the word out. And let’s assume in your organization, there are 10,000 people and let’s assume that 200 of them need to know. But there’s also 200 that need to know that are not in your organization, they’re in other organizations that are subcontractors and consultants to you.

Thomas Grisham: How do you get the word out, quickly and efficiently, so that everybody gets the same idea? Because you know, the old plan that you tell Sam and Sam tells Jill and Jill tells Tom and then Tom repeats it to Fred. Fred hears something different.

And so if you think about it, the most efficient way would be, if you, as the CEO could turn to one person and say, Bill, let everybody know. Okay, I’m done, now it’s Bill’s turn. Okay. Bill’s got it now. Bill’s still got 200 people out there.

Thomas Grisham: In a hierarchical organization, Bill tells Tim, Fred, and Sam. Now Bill’s done. Tim, Fred and Sam tells. (inaudible) So you can picture how this has to cascade down.

Thomas Grisham: By the time everybody who needs to know this gets the message, the products are already in Russia. Now you got a different problem.

Thomas Grisham: So in an agile organization, when I said flat, what I mean is Bill, for example, would turn to four people who have four people working for them and four people working for them, that kind of thing. Because four, six people, the research says is about the limit for CEO.

Thomas Grisham: I’ve seen CEOs with 12 and 18, it doesn’t work terribly well. There’s too many people.

Thomas Grisham: And so if you think, just dividing the organization into fours or sixes, that kind of thing, and then think through the numbers, the idea is you have to empower each one of those levels with more authority and responsibility.

Thomas Grisham: So it’s not just Bill in charge of design of products, it’s Bill in charge of R&amp;D, design of projects, manufacturing of projects and customer service. That means Bill has got to be a pretty darned good guy. So when you hire him, he needs to have a broad set of skills so that he can function in those positions.

Thomas Grisham: So in a perfect world, you have the design, you know what each position requires and you acquire that asset. In the real world, where you have a hierarchical organization that needs to be more flexible.

Small as possible without overwork

-–

Thomas Grisham: My idea is, you go through the same math. How can I make this as small as possible, but still not overwork people. Come up with some numbers, come up with a basic design and then set just like you would for a strategy, a board of directors, five-year strategy, CEO’s job, and the people in the organization are tasked with a one-year tactical plan.

Thomas Grisham: How do we build for one year, what we need to build in order to achieve five years of the strategic plan? And then you adjust as you need to, during the 12 months. Each month you take a look.

Dual responsibilities

-–

Thomas Grisham: So you go back and you look at a way to make one first step. We need, let’s take the Operations group and let’s merge it with R&amp;D. Just as an example. And so we’re going to give those people dual responsibilities. You may have technical layout guys, for example, if you’re a pharmaceutical firm, you may have technical geneticists, for example, that you hire, but you don’t want three layers on top of them. So that if they see a problem, for example, oh, we’re starting on this genetic test, but the problem was, we just realized that there’s a new variant to the virus out there. Oh my God, should we stop? Should we continue? What should we do?

Thomas Grisham: In order for a decision to be made that quickly, somebody has to know how to interpret what they’re saying.

I’m sorry, I’m not a geneticist, I’m a finance guy, what the hell are you talking about? And then the technical guys and the geneticists say, I don’t know, what are you talking about with cash flow, you know?

Thomas Grisham: So the dilemma is what you need are a couple of layers of people who are more like a Renaissance woman, someone who’s trained with one background, but has been put into the system.

Thomas Grisham: Give you one example, 3M, the company that makes sticky stuff, they move people from accounting into R&amp;D. Why in the hell would you do that as a company? And the reason is. Because they walk in with stupid questions. What does this do? And instead of giving them an explanation of, well, yeah, just the polymetric structure of this and the chemistry, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. No, no, my question is, what does it do? Does it stick for good or is it like a Post-It note where it comes off?

Thomas Grisham: And likewise, the R&amp;D guys that go into bookkeeping got no clue. But what happens at the end of it is, now you have a different world year.

Global View with Local Heart

-–

Thomas Grisham: One more example, quickly. We, like all companies, and here’s another difficulty for global guys. I want to build a new team in India. We’re going to open an office. Okay, question is, do you hire an Indian guy and train him to think like a global guy or do you take an American guy and train him in the culture of India? We answer that question by saying, we’ll take an Indian guy and put global goggles on him.

Thomas Grisham: So they sent him to me, I trained him, we sent him to, I was in Thailand, we sent him to Korea. We sent him back into India. Now you have a global view with a local heart.

Thomas Grisham: And the idea now is that instead of needing two people, for example, a Western person, who’s got the global standards and connection to the board of directors and all of that in her head, and a local person who understands the culture and how politics in the economy works in India.

Thomas Grisham: And you put two of them in. That would be a typical hierarchical approach. In a more virtual, more changing world that’s more flexible, agile, you just want one.

Thomas Grisham: And so the question is, which way do you go with this? Those are the kind of dilemmas Bill, that everyone faces, no matter what business they’re in. The only difference that businesses make is that things that the United Nations does, compared to Lufthansa. The businesses they work in just require different skillsets and different kinds of backgrounds and language skills, things like that.

Fewer People with More Responsibility

-–

Thomas Grisham: So that’s the way I see this again, to repeat is, to be more agile and flexible, you need to be as flat as you can be, which means you need to have fewer people with more responsibility and more authority, within the boundaries of what you can accomplish.

Thomas Grisham: You know, I’m telling you what the perfect world looks like. You need to have quick, easy communications across the organizations.

Thomas Grisham: I’ll give you an example, there was a group I was doing training for in Beijing, this R&amp;D company. And they had a couple thousand people scattered around the planet doing different kinds of things, but they had all come together. So this was training on how to do agile from Beijing. True agile, you know, no paper, no schedules, no estimates, blah, blah, blah, all that stuff.

Thomas Grisham: How do we have teams in six different time zones doing this? They had figured that out heading down, and what they found is that they built themselves a hub. So that instead of me emailing seven people in six time zones, you need to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you simply like a tweet, put it up on a hub.

Thomas Grisham: Now everybody can see everybody’s comments all at the same time. There’s one communication. That simplified their life. So they used the technology to make sure that the communications took almost no time at all. It was super quick.

Thomas Grisham: So you can do it, but you have to have the goal in mind, which is, I want everybody to know everything. I want complete transparency. You know, it’s not even possible to do that, but that’s the goal. That’s the vision that you sort of strive toward.

Thomas Grisham: And then the third thing again, is the people.

PhD vs Engaged

-–

Thomas Grisham: One more quick example, if I can.I was hired to do, the first piece of technology done in the United States is a piece of Finnish technology. Never done here before. So all brand new stuff, you know, cutting edge. So I was working at a university, I got off the plane, went to visit with a chancellor. Chancellor said, great to have you, pick anybody you want, they’re all starving college kids, you know. They work for free. Okay. Where’s the engineering school, I said? And his eyes got kind of wide and his mouth fell open.

He said, I don’t have an engineering school. I have arts, I have medicine.

Thomas Grisham: So I thought, okay, how am I going to fulfill my first idea here, which is the assets need to be right? What I ended up with was a road scholar in Italian art, a PhD in psychology and another collection of crazy, unusual people.

Thomas Grisham: I thought, I’m toast, this is not going to work.

Thomas Grisham: But what I found out was, they came in just like the 3M story. They came in each day and said to me, hey, here’s a picture of this thing, I just saw it. What does this do? Ah, endlessly curious, endlessly interested and engaged.

Thomas Grisham: What I learned was, I don’t need PhDs in electronics. I need people who are wanting to come to work because they’re happy and because they’re engaged in what they do. I can’t wait to get there tomorrow, I hope something changes, I sure would hate to do the same thing two days in a row.

Thomas Grisham: You can do it, but it requires the leadership, the XLQ to know. My definition of leadership is the ability to inspire the desire to follow. People choose who they follow.

Thomas Grisham: And the second piece is to inspire achievement beyond expectations. And what I mean is, the expectations of the person who I’m leading. So if I work for Bill and Bill knows Tom’s not the brightest tack in the box, he could be a whole lot better at writing code than he is. And you give me a new piece of work to do, and I’m terrified. You can tell. But you support me. You let me experience it, you permit me to fail if I have to. That requires the kind of leadership that the C-suite people need to see and imbue in an organization. That’s not easy.

Bill Raymond: No, it’s definitely not. And then I think about the fact that, you know, very often when we’re talking about organizational agility, when we get to companies that are that size of 10,000 or larger, globally-dispersed, the number of levels in the organization seems to increase exponentially.

What does a flat organization look like in terms of numbers?

-–

Bill Raymond: And so you’re talking about keeping as flat a level of organization as possible. What’s that number? What does that number look like? Because I can think of any number of companies, 10,000 or over where the number of levels is at least 12, if not more.

Thomas Grisham: Yeah. For example, using Lufthansa, because they have, let’s say a quarter of a million people working for them, something like that. Some of them are Lufthansa employees. Some of them are outsourced employees, temporary workers, consultants, things like that. And so you’re right, it’s this collage of assets that exist, and what I tell them and what I suggest to people who have such large organizations that are global, is to try and look at them as individual component pieces.

Thomas Grisham: So for example, for Lufthansa, they have Lufthansa Technik. They’re the guys that, you know, fix the airplanes and parts and food and all that kind of stuff. And they’re scattered in, oh, I don’t know, couple dozen countries, at least, something like that. And what I suggested to them was, just look at your organization, look at one piece of it first, and see if there’s a way that you can reduce the distance from the top to the bottom.

Thomas Grisham: Try to find, for example, let’s say you have level one as CEO, for example. Let’s say that you have at level 5, 20 people. Can you reduce that to 19? And the question then becomes, let’s put a new person in, that we hire specifically with a skillset that’s able to work in that kind of environment. They thrive in that kind of environment.

Thomas Grisham: And let’s do a test. Let’s give it six months and we’ll do metrics on it each time. So for example, it’s not difficult to do metrics on communications or knowledge. You have to set it up and you need the technology to support all this.

Take it a piece at a time

-–

Thomas Grisham: So my suggestion to them is, take it a bite at a time. You can’t just trash an organization that’s this size, you can’t rebuild it overnight.

Thomas Grisham: You have to take a piece of it and see if it will work for you as an organization. And honestly Bill, in some cases, it won’t work. In Japan, there are organizations that are Keiretsu, which are groups of organizations that have unwritten ties between themselves, where the communications are not only vertically within one organization, but they’re horizontally across organizations through this buddy system.

Thomas Grisham: The hierarchy is too strong, it is not changeable. Now, more generation, perhaps two, yes. And the people who are now coming into are now different kinds of mindsets than the people they’re replacing.

Thomas Grisham: And so having these conversations with a group of people who are trying to do this in practice, Bill. That’s exactly what I suggest to them is, don’t try and upend everything because you’ll just create more chaos, which is what you don’t need.

Thomas Grisham: But think about this over the next five years. We have 12 levels now in Lufthansa Technik. Let’s see if we can get to 10 over the next two years. Build a plan, set the metrics, keep going.

Thomas Grisham: And that’s the only rational way that I can suggest to you. There’s no right number because, if you have, for example, General Electric, 18 businesses, 130 countries,it’s going to take a lot of people. Yeah.

Thomas Grisham: And so the dilemma is, you can only just take a piece of it and work on the pieces that you think will give you the greatest amount of flexibility.

Thomas Grisham: So it needs to begin at the board level and come down, not begin at the grassroots and try and come up. That won’t work. I know, I’ve tried it, I’ve seen it. Doesn’t work.

Bill Raymond: I mean, I think I’ve seen some teams, some groups adopt agility and in whatever sense that means. Usually when someone says that, they mean a framework like SCRUM or SAFe, or they mean that they’ve adopted some practices that, you know, help them kind of communicate better.

Bill Raymond: And what I’ve seen very often is they feel better because they have some sort of a planning process, they call it sprint planning. They have you know, time that they set aside to get that work done, and then they have time that they set aside to really deliver on what they planned. And that seems to work out fairly well, and we see that happen in the software development and IT world, fairly well.

Bill Raymond: The problem is that the rest of the organization isn’t behind all of this. And then you end up with all these external factors that almost try to force you back into some other way of doing things.

The Mindset of a Leader

-–

Bill Raymond: So let’s think about that from the mindset elements that we’ve been talking about in this podcast, what would a leader that’s maybe shifting to agility, what is the mindset that a leader should have, so that they can kind of keep this open mind and think about new ways of structuring the organization and thinking about how teams might function, you know, more productively?

That’s a good question, and it’s a big one.

Yeah, to oversimplify this quite a bit, the thing that I have suggested to many people and has worked, because again, depending on whether the organization is an IT organization by nature, or it’s this conglomerate thing that’s got an IT component, but it does a lot of other things, will make a huge amount of difference.

Thomas Grisham: But if we just confine it to the IT for just a second and just think about that arena. If you had a company,the kind of person that you would want being, let’s say a mid-level leader, somebody who’s, maybe two steps, one step, two step removed from the CEO, something like that.

Empower those under you

-–

Thomas Grisham: What you want to do, if you’re capable of it, what you want to do is you want to empower the people who are under you and adjacent to you to make their own decisions. That means that you’ve got to be responsible for their mistakes.

Thomas Grisham: The problem with leadership is, to be a leader, you have to be vulnerable. You have to expose yourself to risks for other people’s mistakes. People learn by making mistakes, they don’t learn by getting it right.

Thomas Grisham: And so think of it in that term. As a leader, you are in charge of mistakes. That’s really uncomfortable for a lot of people. And that’s the key. That is the absolute foundation for this, because there is no possible way that you can learn everything you need to know to work in this world today. It’s not possible.

Thomas Grisham: You’re going to make mistakes, whether you’re the board or whether you’re a person working, you know, writing code or factoring it or whatever else you do in the company, the key to it is to empower the people, to let them make their own decisions because you hired them as experts. Leave them alone and just support them.

Thomas Grisham: So if they call you and say, you know, I got too much going on, I can’t focus on all this. The answer is not, work more hours. The answer is, let me see if I can take some of that off of you. That means that you’re going to have to go find some more help, which means your budget’s going to go up, which means you’re going to get blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Thomas Grisham: And so the key to it is, you have to be comfortable in your own skin. Nietzsche said, if you’re not happy being alone, you’re a bad company. You need to be comfortable and solid in your knowledge of yourself. You can’t lead other people unless you know who you are. And so emotional intelligence, to use the academic term, maturity, to use a more common term, is fundamental in my mind.

Bill Raymond: Yeah, that, I think resonates with me as well. You know, I’ve gone through a number of organizational transformation projects. Some of them as an employee, some of them as even a consultant. And one of the interesting things that I always did find was that, as you know, you said you have to be comfortable with making mistakes and take accountability for that.

Bill Raymond: I do think that the more you shrink an organization and I think you used something along the lines of six levels or, you know, when it gets to that point, you can’t be an expert in everything anymore. You know, you do have to just trust that people are out there doing the work that they need to, and you’re just keeping a pulse on it.

Bill Raymond: And my experience with these types of things is that, as I think you were alluding to, you spend a lot of time thinking about how to alleviate the pressure on the team so that they can do more work. And that might mean hiring more staff. It might mean helping to change internal corporate processes. I can work with my other colleagues to maybe cut out some of that proverbial red tape for example, because I see the pain that my team’s experiencing.

Bill Raymond: And yes, people will make a mistake and yes, you need to take accountability for it. But I think the important thing here is that even as mistakes get made, you know, there’s a acceptance in the organization that we are putting trust in people where we don’t necessarily have direct everyday knowledge of everything that’s going on, and that we focus on fixing the problem, not focus on targeting the person.

Broaden your horizon

-–

Thomas Grisham: Yes. I agree with you a hundred percent. And as you can imagine, and everyone listening can imagine, if you have a company with 10,000 people and you did everything that I said, you know, at the beginning, you designed it before you hired anybody. Where are you going to find 10,000 people like that?

Bill Raymond: mm-hmm

Thomas Grisham: And so the dilemma what most companies that I’ve consulted with, what I’ve suggested to them is, you need to broaden your horizon. There are people working in Ghana today who have exactly the characteristics you want. The problem is they have been suppressed into a culture that causes them to think in ways that are not particularly useful. Can you adjust that?

Thomas Grisham: And so my suggestion to people is, look globally when you’re looking for these kind of assets. You’ll find them in every country. I promise you I’ve done it. You’ll find them everywhere, but the thing is, picking them is not quick. It is not easy. You need someone who has emotional intelligence and knows where you’re headed.

Thomas Grisham: And I don’t mean, okay, here’s the nature of a person, go out and find me a bunch of EQP.

Thomas Grisham: No. Here is a person who knows how the company works, understands the vision and the product and the customer, but happens to spend some of their day hiring people. That’s a completely different mindset, and it’s one that you have to build into the organization, as I said, from top, down.

Thomas Grisham: You can do the individual projects and stuff bottom-up, and companies will look at them and say, wow, hey, that’s really cool. I wonder if we can make that a global thing. And that’s where, you know, this interface that we’ve been talking about comes in. Because most companies go exactly that direction because it’s easier. Oh, I’ll get yours six IT guys, let me just stick them in a room, leave them alone, they’ll come out in two weeks and oh, we got something we can use.

Thomas Grisham: I will tell your audience one more thing. I did my first agile project in 1975. In 1975, we didn’t have computers yet, let alone cell phones. But it was exactly the same idea. Precisely, we didn’t call it agile, but it was precisely the same idea as IT agile, as you described it.

Thomas Grisham: We realized that if you want to get something done quickly, you have to make a direct connection between the person who needs something, call them a customer, and the person doing it.

Thomas Grisham: Number two, give them enough time to do it. I’d like you to sweep the house, clean up the garden, wash the car, do these four codes for these six projects, answer 200 emails, don’t sleep tonight and come in with a happy attitude tomorrow. Thanks very much.

So the dilemma, Bill, is that everybody knows what they need to do. This is not new. Every MBA student, PhD student I’ve taught over the last 20 years, they get all this. I’ve taught them and they walk in an organization and go, oh, oh, you didn’t tell me what I was supposed to do with it. How do I use this in an organization that’s hierarchical?

Thomas Grisham: And I agree with you. I think that the thing is you just look for the kind of talent that is comfortable walking in those shoes that we were describing, and you do them one at a time.

People need to show their value and be seen

-–

Bill Raymond: Yeah, I think that’s really good insight. And although sounds simple, it’s really not because you do have to think about that vision that you talked about, you have to think about the, you know, types of people that you value, the way in which they work. You have to make sure that there’s a space for them to be able to show their value, right?

They want to be seen, they want to progress in their career and then you have to make sure that, you know, that they’re all going to work in this way that you expect.

Bill Raymond: I can tell you from experience, and I think you’re saying, talking from experience as well with everything you’re saying here. But you know, I just remembered there are some organizations I worked in where we always would get together and talk to a potential new hire, and we’d find time for them and we’d share our culture. But then there’d always be this sort of one role or this one important kind of, someone sees it as strategic role, where no one gets involved. And one or two people make this decision without letting anyone else know, and then they bring this person in. And 100% of the time that person was not a cultural fit because they weren’t vetted by the people that they had to work with.

Thomas Grisham: Yes. I agree.

Thomas Grisham: Okay, let me just say this. Think about it this way, in really just simple terms. If you’re the chairman of the board of directors for a company, your job is to think strategically. You know, what’s coming? What kind of competition’s out there? What do we need to be doing five years from now? So you know, those kind of things.

Thomas Grisham: And in many companies that I’ve worked for, and I’m sure you as well, one of the values that everybody has hanging over their front door is, customer first. Oh, okay.

Thomas Grisham: And what I’m sure, you know, as well as I do is when you get down to level 12 or whatever it is, and you have an IT person working with a customer, and the IT person knows perfectly well that if they provide exactly what was in the contract, the customer will be wholly unhappy, and it will not be functional.

Thomas Grisham: So just think of that for a second. So you have a board of directors member who doesn’t know this person, and you have this person who doesn’t know anybody on the board of directors.

Thomas Grisham: What does this person do? Do they do what you told them to do as value and make the customer satisfied? Or do they do what you told them to do because of the contract, which is give them this much and then stop. And if you guessed wrong, we’re going to fire you. Think about that scenario. It’s a real simple one that happens every day around the planet.

Thomas Grisham: If you want to cut that cord in that system, who needs to do something? And that’s the answer to the question. It’s all of those people in that communication chain, because if the board of directors says, the slogan needs to be customer satisfaction first, but in fact, our values are, we need to make our numbers for quarter 1 in 2023.

Thomas Grisham: And the person at the bottom doesn’t know that’s the current plan. Everybody’s going to be off in different directions. That’s what creates some of the chaos in organizations. And as we had discussed, the fix for that is, it’s in the middle of that chain. That’s where it exists, and that’s where you need to focus.

Bill Raymond: Yeah that’s really good insight. I very much appreciate that.

Some takeaways to implement these changes

-–

Bill Raymond: As we’re wrapping up the podcast, if there’s any leaders listening to this podcast right now and they’re listening to the things that you have to say,what are maybe one or two things that they can walk away with and start doing right now, that doesn’t need a lot of training or reading up on,that could start to implement these changes?

There’s I would say, it would begin with just personal reflection. Look at yourself in the mirror, honestly. If you Google, emotional intelligence, there’s a ton of free metrics out there online that’ll give you kind of a clue of where you are. But the idea is I’d say, look in the mirror honestly first.

Thomas Grisham: And then one thing that helps would be just to keep yourself a simple diary for maybe a week or two, where if you’ve got five people working for you, ask them a couple of simple questions. You know, Monday morning, Bill, are you happy? And write down the response. And you know, if they’re not terrified of telling you the truth, deal with that first or walk over there.

Thomas Grisham: But if they’re willing to tell you the truth and say, you know, God, I need help here, man. I’m my family, blah, blah. But whatever the issue may be. Offer to help and write it down.

Thomas Grisham: And then a week from then after you’ve helped this one person, go back and ask the same question again. And ask yourself the same question again, by looking in the mirror. It’s a stupidly simple way to begin, but the essence of all this is really simple, you lead from behind.

Thomas Grisham: If you are the leader, your job is to support people and to remove barricades. Your job is not to tell them what to do or tell them how to do it. Millennials, all of the literature shows that’s exactly the wrong thing to do. So many, if not, most of the IT people out there wandering around the planet, it’s exactly the wrong thing to do.

Thomas Grisham: Tell them what you need, support them and get out of the way. Practice empowerment by doing it. It’s really not complicated. Give it a try. I’ve suggested this to a lot of people and it’s a good way to begin.

Bill Raymond: And thank you for that. I do appreciate it. You know, I know that I had this revelation sometime in, you know, I am a very hands-on person. I get excited about the details of work. And that doesn’t necessarily mean I want to be a micromanager. It means that I get excited about whatever it is, the technology, the advertising, whatever it is that I happen to be working on, I get so into it that I start engaging with the teams. And the teams know that I’m the senior person in the room. And so as I start throwing out ideas, people start looking at that as me telling them what to do.

Bill Raymond: And when I start asking questions to learn more because I’m excited about it, and I’m just, and I’m interested, people are saying, I’m spending too much time working with you and not actually getting the work done.

Bill Raymond: And so I’ve definitely had those look-in-the-mirror moments to say, why does my team seem unhappy? And there was a lot of times when they would say something along the lines of, you know, Bill, you know, you’re too involved. And I just did not get it, right? Because people want to be, if you will, politically correct and they will try not to come right at you and tell you what the problem is. They’ll use terms and you have to kind of figure out really what you’re doing.

Bill Raymond: And I remembered when I was hearing that my team wasn’t too happy with what I was doing, and I knew that I needed to change and I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. You know, I brought in a coach, and that coach sat in on a month’s worth of meetings, team meetings with me. They did not engage at all, they just listened. And then I got the feedback that told me that this is the problem.

Bill Raymond: And so I was able to step back and just say, okay, I’m doing actions that are reducing the capability of my team. And so sometimes that looking in the mirror can be hard without really know what people are thinking.

Bill Raymond: I like your diary idea as well, just kind of writing these things down. It gives you a self-inflection point. So I really appreciate that.

        <title>What it means to become nimble</title>

        <content>Today, I am excited to share a conversation with Christina Wodtke, a celebrity in agile leadership and team dynamics. Christina is the author of popular books like The Team that Managed Itself and Radical Focus.

Christina brings a wealth of agile knowledge in the agile space, having worked with tech companies like LinkedIn, Zynga, and Yahoo!, not to mention having founded three startups.

Christina is an executive leadership coach who teaches techniques to create high-performing teams at the prestigious Stanford University.

I am excited to share that Christina will share her new thoughts and ideas concerning nimble and stable teams.

In this conversation, you will hear Christina talk about the importance of Psychological Safety. If you are unfamiliar with the topic, I suggest you locate the podcast just before the one you are listening to now. It is titled Building a Culture of Psychological Safety and contains a fantastic conversation with Alla Weinberg as an introduction to the topic.

Christina will also talk frequently about OKRs – or objectives and key results. If you are unfamiliar with the topic, you can listen to my conversation with Christina’s friend and colleague, Jeff Gothelf. You can find that conversation in the Agile in Action podcast titled “Introducing Objectives and Key Results.”</content>
