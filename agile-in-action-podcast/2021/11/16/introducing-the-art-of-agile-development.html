        <h2>Introducing the Art of Agile Development, 2nd Edition</h2><p>Veteran guest on the Agile in Action Podcast, James Shore returns to announce the general availability of his new book, The Art of Agile Development, the Second Edition. James shares what you will learn and how development teams can benefit from the book, including walking through the Fluency Model. In the text below, you will find the book’s description, including a link to get a copy for yourself.</p>

<p>Most companies developing software employ something they call “Agile.” But there’s widespread misunderstanding of what Agile is and how to use it. If you want to improve your software development team’s agility, this comprehensive guidebook’s clear, concrete, and detailed guidance explains what to do and why, and when to make trade-offs.</p>

<p>In this thorough update of the classic Agile how-to guide, James Shore provides no-nonsense advice on Agile adoption, planning, development, delivery, and management taken from over two decades of Agile experience. He brings the latest ideas from Extreme Programming, Scrum, Lean, DevOps, and more into a cohesive whole. Learn how to successfully bring Agile development to your team and organization–or discover why Agile might not be for you.</p>

<p>This book explains how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve agility: create the conditions necessary for Agile to succeed and scale in your organization</li>
  <li>Focus on value: work as a team, understand priorities, provide visibility, and improve continuously</li>
  <li>Deliver software reliably: share ownership, decrease development costs, evolve designs, and deploy continuously</li>
  <li>Optimize value: take ownership of product plans, budgets, and experiments–and produce market-leading software</li>
</ul>
