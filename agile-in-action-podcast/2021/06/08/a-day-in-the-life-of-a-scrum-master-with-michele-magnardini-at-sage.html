        <h2>In this episode</h2><p>When you think about agile teams, or more specifically, Scrum teams, you will often hear about a role called the Scrum Master. That role is frequently confused, and you will often hear the position referred to as a project manager with a new and modern title.</p>

<p>For some, agile is a brand-new way to work, and therefore a brand new way of structuring your organization. Any organizational change requires new or changed roles, adjusting to a new culture, and shifting focus. That change is never-ending because customer needs, products, and technology will not stop changing our business landscape.</p>

<p>In today’s podcast, I speak with Michele Magnardini, Scrum Master at Sage. He talks about the role of a Scrum Master, which helps improve team dynamics and plays a critical role in continuous team improvements. If your organization is considering adopting agile, you likely came across the term Scrum. Agile and Scrum can represent a tectonic shift in how companies work and structure teams. Embracing this change is not a one-and-done project but an entirely new way of working, which means change will be continuous, with regular improvements in support of teams to deliver customer value.</p>

<p>In today’s fun and lively conversation Michele makes no assumptions that you are a Scrum expert, walking you through all the basics. You will learn how Scrum works, including the roles, meetings, and artifacts defined by the framework. Then, he shares the critical role of a Scrum Master.</p>

<p>Sadly, many consider the Scrum Master as a project manager with a new, modern title. That cannot be farther from the truth, and you will learn just how important the Scrum Master’s role is to that continuous improvement process I share earlier in this post.</p>
