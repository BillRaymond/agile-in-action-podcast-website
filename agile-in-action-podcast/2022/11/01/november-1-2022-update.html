<strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Hi, this is bill Raymond host of the agile and action podcast. Today is Tuesday, November 1st, 2022.

<p><strong>Sponsor:</strong> The future of work is, shall we say, stormy, and it looks like things are not changing anytime soon. So how do you weather these storms and stay competitive while continuing to innovate? Recent studies have shown that when you put psychological safety first, people will work at their highest IQ and be capable of analytical thinking and collaborative problem solving. Do you want to see these improvements in your organization? If so, I want to introduce you to Alla Weinberg, founder of Spoke and Wheel.</p>

<p>Alla and her talented team will perform a 90-day psychological safety sprint that will assess your culture against three critical areas.</p>
