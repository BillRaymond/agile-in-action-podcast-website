<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Sometimes we think that our actions are the right actions and we think we’re being compassionate and accountable when maybe, there’s still room for improvement. How do we look into ourselves and recognize that?</p>

<p>[00:00:12] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> I’ll jump straight to the very end of the book. near the very end, I share three questions that you should include in every single survey you ever ask.</p>

<p>They’re based on the three switches of the compassion mindset, which are based on the working definition of compassion.</p>

<p>After an interaction with me, do you feel more or less valuable as a human being? Number two, after an interaction with me, do you feel more or less capable and competent than you did before? And the third one is, after an interaction with me, do you feel more ownership and empowerment than you did before? That’s responsibility. So we might be surprised what would come back if we really asked those questions.</p>

<p>[00:00:48] <strong>Speaker:</strong> Welcome to the Agile in Action Podcast with Bill Raymond. Bill will explore how business disruptors are adopting agile techniques to gain a competitive advantage in this fast-paced technology driven market.</p>

<p>[00:01:01] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Hi, and welcome to the podcast. Today I’m joined by Nate Regier, PhD, CEO of Next Element Consulting and author of Compassionate Accountability, How Leaders Build Connection and Get Results.</p>

<p>Hi Nate, how are you today?</p>

<p>[00:01:16] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> I’m well, Bill, thanks for having me on. It’s great to see you today. Great to be with your listeners.</p>

<p>[00:01:20] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I’m really looking forward to this. Not only are we celebrating your book launch and talking about that, but we’re also going to do a little bit of a deep dive into it and learn what people might learn when reading your book, and it’s all about compassionate accountability. Before we get into what that means, could you introduce yourself?</p>

<p>[00:01:40] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Like you said, I am Nate Regier. I am the CEO of Next Element, and we are a global consulting firm that specializes in helping leaders build cultures of compassionate accountability. Been around since 2008 and uh, we actually, our headquarters are here in Kansas and we have a global network of trainers that work for us, that work with us, sharing the message of compassionate accountability.</p>

<p>And, I might just say I’m actually a recovering psychologist, which means that in a previous life, that’s what I did. And, all jokes aside, that’s a very important part of what I do and how I see the world. Yeah, we’re here and this has been quite an interesting ride over the last five years as a entrepreneur, business owner, leadership consultant.</p>

<p>[00:02:20] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And I am just finishing your book. I’m really liking it. I appreciate you providing me with an early copy so I could get an early read. And I think it would be great if we could just get a broad stroke overview of what you mean by compassionate accountability.</p>

<p>[00:02:35] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Sure. Thank you for that. You know when people see that phrase with those two words together, I usually get two reactions. The first reaction is this puzzled look. Wait, those words aren’t supposed to go together. I. Then if it’s a leader or a parent or a coach who has lived any amount of life, the next look they give me is, oh my gosh, yes.</p>

<p>And that’s the whole idea is that, for as long as we’ve been human, we have been struggling with the human need and tendency to affiliate. We are social creatures. We want to be together, and we want to have relationships and preserve them, but also as working human beings that want to achieve things.</p>

<p>We also want to get results. And there’s been this historic tension between the two. Like when push comes to shove, you have to choose one or the other. Or sometimes those are, those feel like they’re intention with each other. So we have been playing with that tension and finding solutions to that tension for our entire, existence as next element.</p>

<p>And so it was time to write the book about how that happens.</p>

<p>[00:03:36] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> These are two words that might seem diametrically opposed. So maybe what you can do is drill down a little bit and talk about what you mean by. Compassion and then we’ll talk about accountability and how we bring those together.</p>

<p>[00:03:49] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> I’m glad you asked that because we do need to look at the word compassion first. I think.</p>

<p>[00:03:53] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> the word compassion is, I think, really misunderstood, and particularly in the workplace and part of my book talks about the history and the evolution of compassion. how we look at it and how we see it in the working world.</p>

<p>[00:04:06] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> It’s really a popular term that everybody’s researching and writing about. But when you really go to the root of the word compassion, it comes from the Latin root, meaning with suffer calm means with passion means to suffer or to struggle.</p>

<p>Compassion means to struggle with other people and that really implies something pretty significant in terms of what kind of relationship we have people with people during the struggle and life is struggle, work is struggle. And so that kind of spurred us on into more of a working definition of what is compassion, truly as a way to lay the foundation for struggling with each other in the most difficult times.</p>

<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And I think I, we can all agree that we’re going through some difficult times at the moment,</p>

<p>[00:04:50] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Yeah. Yeah.</p>

<p>[00:04:52] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And I completely understand that. we are going through some tough times and also we’re just coming out of a tough time too, right? we had a few years of lockdown and maybe trying to</p>

<p>find out who we are again and how we interact with people in a different way. And going back into the office, this is all kind of a point in time right now, but this won’t end. We’ll always be working with others to accomplish some sort of an objective.</p>

<p>[00:05:15] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Yeah, for sure. And this difficult time that we’re coming out of or that we’re going through with a pandemic, we saw this pendulum just go back and forth. Where at the beginning kind of it was like, oh, we’re all in this together. Everybody’s afraid, you know? And we were like this big unified human species that we’re battling this thing.</p>

<p>But man, things changed quickly. Next thing you know, it’s vaxxers, anti-vaxxers and it’s all this division and disconnection. And I asked myself, where’s the compassion now? And then coming out of that, the whole question was, wait, we gotta get back to work. We got work to do. We got companies to run.</p>

<p>It’s enough of this. Anything goes, work in your pajamas, you know, anytime you want kind of junk, we gotta get back to work. And so now the pendulum’s all the way on the other side. And so this paradox rages on.</p>

<p>[00:06:00] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And I. Guess we’ll continue to see that in any type of work that we do. I think, it’s interesting we look at some of the largest companies in the world, really being successful, but then also laying off thousands of people. And so we think, where’s the compassion there as well.</p>

<p>[00:06:16] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. These are very difficult things and I was earlier on a conversation with a, a good friend of mine, Rob McKenna, an IO psychologist who studies leaders under Pressure, and he was just talking about, you know, leadership. No matter why you get into leadership, inevitably you are going to have to make tough decisions.</p>

<p>You’re going to get flack. You’re gonna ultimately be responsible for some pretty big results. And at the same time, if we can’t do that in a way that builds relationships, builds trust, builds connection, we’re not gonna last personally and we’re not gonna be effective as a leader.</p>

<p>[00:06:50] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And I think that’s where we get into accountability. So maybe you could drill into what you mean by that?</p>

<p>[00:06:54] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Yeah, you know the word accountability. Tends to put people on edge. It has a tough edge because where it’s normally used is holding people accountable. As a little child, it was like you’re accountable for your actions, or as an adult, we need to hold people accountable for their behavior.</p>

<p>And it always seems to come with this notion of, beating people over the head or bringing down the hammer, or implementing consequences or punishment or somehow calling people out and all of that stuff gives accountability a bad rap. Yet we can’t get away from the fact that as human beings in communities and in workplaces, we are accountable for our behavior.</p>

<p>our behaviors matter. But how do we talk about them? How do we address them? How do we set up systems and structures to deal with behaviors in a way that still preserves human dignity and actually brings people closer together in the process? So that’s where we asked ourselves. Why do we see compassion accountability as opposites?</p>

<p>Because real compassion includes accountability. You can’t have real compassion for someone if you’re not talking about real behaviors, if you’re not telling the truth, if you’re not holding each other to a higher standard. Of commitments. So I think we need to stop talking about, let’s be accountable, but be nice while we do it.</p>

<p>I think what we need to talk about is let’s be compassionately accountable and do both at the same time, which is possible.</p>

<p>[00:08:14] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Can you share an example as to what that might look like? Do you have an a real world example?</p>

<p>[00:08:18] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Yeah, I do. Earlier. I was hosting a LinkedIn live event with this, a friend of mine, Ron McKenna. And we were debriefing afterwards and he said, man, I’m really appreciate what we’re doing here. We’re building a great relationship and this is really cool.</p>

<p>Thanks for doing this, really that compassionate side. And he said, and I have some feedback. There’s, here’s some things where I think we could improve here. Here’s where there was a,something I felt should have happened that didn’t happen, and he shared what he wanted and stuff and it wasn’t easy for me to hear, but I knew he cared. I knew he wanted nothing but the best for both of us. And so it’s one of these things where there’s nowhere to hide when somebody is really honest with you in a very safe way, and they’re not, they’re not undermining your humanity. They’re not questioning your integrity. They’re simply talking about behaviors and outcomes.</p>

<p>And it is really a special thing. In the book, I give a lot of examples about how do you do both at the same time. and that, that’s just one recent example in the last few hours of my life.</p>

<p>[00:09:13] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> That’s a great example. I. Think back to, my early days, I feel like this podcast is sometimes, me rethinking all the things that I learned in my career and in my life. because it always sparks something that occurred in a moment that changed the way I work with people or changed my direction as to where I was going.</p>

<p>And, I remember that same kind of thing happened to me. I was. I guess probably still learning how to be a manager, the right way and learning how to work with people that are team members that work for me. And I remembered one of the things that I was doing is I was, I had a new employee onboarding and it was actually my very first employee that I’ve ever onboard, onboarded.</p>

<p>She’d always ask me, you know how she’s doing? And I took that as, oh, okay. let me tell you the things that you are doing that I wouldn’t have done it that way. I think you should be doing it this way instead.</p>

<p>And, one of my coaches, I was fortunate enough to have a company that believed in having coaches on staff to help newly formed managers kind of work through things. And I realized that person wasn’t doing what I said they, I thought they should do. And really what he did was he sat down with me and he said, Bill, when you get into.</p>

<p>A meeting like this, are you a asking the person if it’s okay to have the space to provide feedback? And are you providing feedback on how they’re doing or are you just telling them how you would do things and sometimes this is something that the clarity of that doesn’t come until you actually</p>

<p>hear that feedback from someone. So I’m curious, from your perspective, when does some of these light bulbs go on? Have you, because I think that, of course, you can read the book and you can see, oh, that’s me there. Cuz you have a lot of questions in there that say, do you do this or do you do that?</p>

<p>But I’m curious, sometimes we think that our actions are the right actions and we think we’re being compassionate and accountable when maybe, there’s still room for improvement. How do we look into ourselves and recognize that?</p>

<p>[00:11:24] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Great question and thank, isn’t it great to have coaches, mentors, people that believe in us and want the best? For us and are willing to practice compassionate accountability, in that relationship. It’s wonderful. Thanks for sharing that story. I’ll jump straight to the very end of the book. near the very end, I share three questions that you should include in every single survey you ever ask, and those same three questions</p>

<p>are the kinds of questions we should be asking, the people we supervise, the people we lead, the people we serve, because the answers to those questions will be very revealing and invite us to see things that we never saw. and I’ll just share those questions if you want?</p>

<p>[00:12:02] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Sure.</p>

<p>[00:12:02] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> they’re based on the three switches of the compassion mindset, which are based on the working definition of compassion, which is compassion is the practice of demonstrating that people are valuable.</p>

<p>Capable. Responsible in every interaction. Think about those three things. Value, capability, and responsibility. And when you were jumping in to tell that person what they weren’t doing, that you would’ve done with good intentions, you were inadvertently undermining their capability to learn and grow and find their own solutions.</p>

<p>So we can identify right there and say, Ooh, capability switch turned off. But let’s jump ahead. Imagine if you went to all the people that you cared about serving and y ou asked them these three questions after an interaction with me, do you feel more or less valuable as a human being? Why? What have I done?</p>

<p>Number two, after an interaction with me, do you feel more or less capable and competent than you did before? Why? What did I do? And the third one is, after an interaction with me, do you feel more ownership and empowerment than you did before? That’s responsibility. So we might be surprised what would come back if we really asked those questions.</p>

<p>I. And we might be surprised how it would shift the way we look at ourselves and other people if we went into every engagement asking ourselves, what would it look like if I treated everyone as valuable? What would it look like if I treated everyone as capable? And what would it look like if I treated everyone as responsible?</p>

<p>[00:13:24] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Those are great questions.I think the key there is to be open to their responses and not to put up a blocker, if you will, and accept it for what it is.</p>

<p>[00:13:35] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Yeah, that’s, and that’s why the first switch we’ve identified these three switches is value. we have to treat ourselves as valuable and other people as valuable when we do that, when I treat myself as valuable, what I’m saying is I am deserving of honest feedback. I am deserving of the truth.</p>

<p>I am a valuable human being regardless of, of what people say or do, which means I can take that feedback and still be okay as a human being. And because the other person is valuable, then their perspective matters. Their feelings matter, and their experience of me matters. And then that sets the stage for the next two switches.</p>

<p>[00:14:10] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And so that first switch is value. I actually, am guilty of one of the key things that you mentioned in that, in that chapter, which is assume positive intentions and check assumptions. I think it’s real easy, for me to go into a room and see someone that’s maybe being really aggressive and make an assumption as to why they’re being aggressive. Or see someone that’s super quiet in the corner of the room and then make assumptions as to why they are doing that.</p>

<p>And I find it interesting, once you start talking to people and get to know people, those assumptions are usually completely incorrect. And what you’ve done is you’ve already. If you will, jaded yourself into thinking, you’re putting people into boxes where they don’t belong.</p>

<p>[00:14:58] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> I’m glad you brought that up because in the book where I mentioned that strategy of assume good intentions or positive intentions, check assumptions. There is a strategy to do that. There’s a template for how you actually do that. And I’ll tell you, I remember distinctly a time when I made this mistake.</p>

<p>My wife and I were going for a walk in our neighborhood where we walked every day and there was a part of the walk where we would leave the main street and walk along kind of a a dirt road alley along the highway and then rejoin the other street. And there was two ruts where a car could drive, but mostly it was just people walking.</p>

<p>And we were walking and I heard a noise behind me. I turned around and there’s a car like 50 yards behind me, just idling super slow. Out the window of the car was a leash, and there’s a dog walking on the grass next to this car, whose driver is inside the car. And I turned to my wife and I said, of all the lazy, abusive things you can do, get off your butt.</p>

<p>Walk your darn dog. And I said that to my wife and she looked at me and she goes, we don’t know. I. I’m like, what do you mean we don’t know? Look, it’s pretty obvious, right? As the woman got closer, I realized we realized she was gonna have to pass us, so we moved over and on the way by, she stopped her car and she said, I am so sorry, to get in your way.</p>

<p>I just felt so bad for my dog. I broke my ankle and I haven’t been able to walk him.</p>

<p>[00:16:18] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Oh.</p>

<p>[00:16:19] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> For a week, and so I finally just got in my car to try to do this so I could give him a walk. I felt like the worst human being in the world in that moment. My wife just looks at me and says, we don’t know. And I thought, what a wonderful reminder.</p>

<p>You just don’t know what people are going through and you can see something and jump to conclusions. Or what if you just checked the assumption and said, the story I’m telling myself is this, is that accurate? And the person could say, no, that’s not the story. Here’s the story. I always remember that every time I find myself jumping to conclusions about someone,</p>

<p>[00:16:52] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yeah, that’s a really good story and,you learn a lot about yourself when you do ask those questions as well, because you start to think about, have I done that before? And how can I improve?</p>

<p>[00:17:03] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> yes, and do I do it subtly all the time, and I’m not even aware. But what I’ve learned about myself is of all the three switches, the one of value is the one that’s more. Automatically turns off for me or dims based on my personality. Other people have other switches that they struggle to keep on, but we all have to look inside and figure out where our glitches are.</p>

<p>[00:17:23] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> So we talked about value. The next one is capability. Can you share some thoughts on that?</p>

<p>[00:17:28] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> I think we’d all agree that human beings are valuable. We’re all unconditionally valuable because we’re humans. Although we sometimes compromise that well, we’re not just valuable, we’re also capable because humans are agentic beings. We’re problem solvers, we’re learners. We are a achievers.</p>

<p>So the switch of capability comes with the fundamental assumption that everyone is capable of being part of the solution of contributing. And so if we believe that everyone can contribute under the right conditions, then the question becomes, how can we find out what you bring to the table? How can we arrange the conditions so that you can contribute to your maximum capability?</p>

<p>How can we develop you and help you learn and grow so your capacity grows even more? When the switch is off, we believe the capability is limited. So we place limitations on people. Whether it’s assumptions we make, whether it’s just,stereotypes like short people can’t play front row in volleyball.</p>

<p>It’s if you have a 46 inch vertical, you probably could play front row and volleyball, right? if you’re Spud Webb, you can probably play front row. Or we set up systems and processes that inhibit people from realizing their potential. And that’s the switch of capability.</p>

<p>I liked the capability section because that to me is the one that spoke to the most to what I enjoy most, which is teamwork. And, I, again, I took a few notes on this one, but the one that really stood out to me, that was in there was getting attached to your own solutions.</p>

<p>Oh</p>

<p>[00:18:56] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And of course I think we all do that, right? we come up with an idea and we go run with it and maybe it sounds great in our own minds. And then people start asking, what about this? And what about that? It’s really easy to get in your own head that the right solution is the only one that’s that, that you came up with initially.</p>

<p>And that to me is one of the things that, I think I unlearned pretty early in my life when I started working with teams on a more regular basis. We’re working inventing things, we’re creating things. I think software is always a fun place where you can enjoy this. But,just to hear how there’s times when you’ve been in a meeting or been with other people and you’re all trying to solve this problem, and then someone speaks up and says,</p>

<p>why do we have to keep dealing with that problem? Why don’t we just reinvent this thing or go this other path? And everyone goes, yeah. How come we never thought of that? Because you, because we’re all, because we’re all stuck there. and I think that, that to me is the fun one, right?</p>

<p>It’s that letting everyone else unlock ideas so that you can come up with the best solution.</p>

<p>[00:20:04] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> So true. And this capability switch to turn it on requires a lot of different things. There were certain conditions necessary for that scenario. You described. One, we had to have the hu Everyone has to have the humility to not have their identity wrapped up in their idea and rather rejoice in the best idea rather than</p>

<p>my idea. We also had to have a safe place for people to fail because if I’m invested in my ideas, because I’m saying that’s a sign of my competence, and then my idea doesn’t get picked or it gets improved on or changed, then what does that mean for who I am and it can, I feel safe enough in this group that I’m not going to be judged based on whether I’m the only one that has great ideas.</p>

<p>So there are things that we have to do to create the conditions for people to go there and be able to do that. And, people that are more independent problem solvers, autonomous people, maybe, logical thinkers, they do tend to get really attached because that’s their work, that’s what they do.</p>

<p>And so it is hard sometimes to be a team player in an environment like that, but it can be done. And of course it’s extremely rewarding.</p>

<p>[00:21:09] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> We talked about the two switches, value and capability. Let’s talk about the last one, which is responsibility.</p>

<p>[00:21:15] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Yes. the first two switches paved the way for the last one, which is responsibility. And this switch is based on the fundamental truth that no matter what happened before, I am a hundred percent responsible for what I do next. And that includes my thoughts, my feelings, and my behaviors, and that’s all I’m responsible for.</p>

<p>That’s the other thing. I can’t be responsible for anything else except those things. Now, and I must let other people do the same because part of what it means to be human, individual, human beings is that we do have boundaries. We are also connected, but because we have boundaries, we are also responsible for our behaviors.</p>

<p>And this is where a lot of leaders trip up is. They get confused about what they’re responsible for and what they’re not. They either try to take on too much responsibility for other people’s behaviors, feelings, thoughts, or not enough. Either way, we are abdicating our responsibility role in turning the switch off.</p>

<p>But also, let’s go back to your creativity situation where really cool, innovative things happen when we just think outside the box. We’re willing to work as a team. However, at the end of the day, in a company, the, that is a means to an end, which is performance. Production. Bottom line. we enjoy doing it, but if that was an end in of itself, we wouldn’t have a job.</p>

<p>So ultimately we are responsible for results and we have to create conditions to get there. So responsibility is a fine line. A lot of leaders struggle with this. they just, when push comes to shove, they get confused and start to get messy around the lines, around responsibility.</p>

<p>[00:22:45] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I’d like to drill into that just a little bit more if we could. I, when I think about. Responsibility. I think about the fact that, there’s something I am doing right now that has some sort of an outcome and I’ve taken that on myself in this example. and my clients might say, you are responsible for this component and I might have a team responsible for that as well. The word responsible responsibility, it can take on many different meanings.</p>

<p>It can say, here’s the thing that I’m doing, but also I can say, here’s the thing that someone’s told me I am responsible for, or as a leader, this is something that I know, it’s part of my remit. People are going to come to me and say, you didn’t accomplish this thing.</p>

<p>How come you didn’t? How does a leader think about responsibility in terms of the things that. they have to do meaning the, that email they need to send the meeting they need to attend the objectives that they set forth versus the people that are,also working with them in the team.</p>

<p>But you are looked at as the, as the "one" with the answers.</p>

<p>[00:23:56] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Lot of great scenarios there. Let’s take a real simple one. Let’s say I have, I put a lot of pressure on myself because to attend these meetings, it may be unclear whether I have to be there or not, but I feel like I should and I need to show up well, and I need to have everything in order because what if they call on me?</p>

<p>I need to have all the answers. And inside I’m scared. I’m scared about how I look. I’m afraid that what if I say something and it’s not accurate? What if I put the numbers out there that my assistant calculated and there’s a mistake? I have these anxieties and these fears as well as all these pressures I put on myself, but I don’t tell anybody about those.</p>

<p>All they see is how I’m acting, but they know nothing about why I’m doing that. My choice not to tell anybody and not to ask for help is irresponsible. I am abdicating my own responsibility for my own feelings, and by doing that, I’m setting myself up to fail and burn out. I’m also preventing myself from having a team</p>

<p>that can help me and I share a story about that actually in the book. Let’s take another example. I’m a leader and one of my employees comes in and they’re complaining about someone else’s not doing their fair share. how often have we had that? And as a leader, let’s say your knee-jerk reaction is, I’ll go talk to ‘em.</p>

<p>I’m their boss. I’ll go talk ‘em. I’ll tell ‘em. And so you go do that. And now what you’ve done is you’ve taken over responsibility for your employee’s job, which is you need to talk to your peer. Your responsibility is to teach your employees how to have tough conversations, not to have those conversations for them.</p>

<p>And so what you’ve done now is taken on too much responsibility. So now after three years of this, you complain that you’re always putting out fires all the time, and your employees don’t know how to have civil conversations. It’s you did that to yourself, It’s about not taking responsibility in the moment or taking too much, and therefore you weren’t choosing your behaviors carefully and ended up being overwhelmed, stressed, complaining, feeling negative about your employees.</p>

<p>Those are just two examples where that fine line can get pretty dicey.</p>

<p>[00:25:51] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yeah, I definitely hear you. You there. certainly we’ve all experienced that, right? Where we immediately go into, fix it mode,</p>

<p>and let me help you solve that problem. Yeah. And very often that’s not going to get you anywhere.</p>

<p>[00:26:05] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> Yeah. and then the advice I have for leaders who feel like they’re doing so much and they don’t know where it ends, and they’re feeling overwhelmed and they’re caught. Two things. Get vulnerable and tell people how you’re doing, really doing, ask for help. It could even be just emotional help. Hey, I just wanna share that I’m struggling.</p>

<p>Is anybody else out there struggling? Oh yeah, me too. Okay. At least I’m not alone. I feel better now. Both of those things are incredibly difficult things to do for leaders in high pressure situations, and yet when they can do that, they can really start freeing up a lot of mental energy and start realizing the possibility that’s there in compassionate accountability.</p>

<p>[00:26:41] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> This is a great conversation. I know we’re wrapping up to the end here. I guess I would like to know how someone might overcome the barriers to getting to this point where they’re starting to think about compassionate accountability because at the very beginning of this podcast, you said, here are the three questions that I always like to ask, but I know that sometimes when we are trying to work on ourselves rather than let’s say, just work on the product that we’re delivering, that can be harder sometimes.</p>

<p>So what are some of the barriers and how might we be able to overcome them?</p>

<p>[00:27:16] <strong>Nate Regier:</strong> the data is clear. There’s no argument, there’s, it’s so proven that compassion improves leadership, improves cultures, it makes work better. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, and that doesn’t mean that from where we come from, where I come from what I bring in, my beliefs, my values, my upbringing, my personality, it doesn’t make it easy.</p>

<p>And so I’ve identified five different barriers. That people have based on their understanding of compassion or misunderstanding. maybe people feel like, compassion is soft. That’s just for bleeding hearts and if I get compassionate, people will walk all over me. Legitimate concern. I have a chapter dedicated to that.</p>

<p>Another one might be, compassion is for selfless servant leaders. And if I’m just give all the time, then what about me? Am I just gonna burn out and I’m already tired enough the way it is. Legitimate concern. I tackle that in one of the chapters. And then just one more is, uh,oh, compassion can’t be learned, my grandmother, she’s so compassionate, but I’m not like her.</p>

<p>I could never learn that she was just born with it, those people, legitimate concern, but it also could be a reason why you won’t try. And so I tackle that and really show the evidence that actually compassion can be learned and anybody can learn it. Anybody can do it Well.</p>
