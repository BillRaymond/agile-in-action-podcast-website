<h3 id="000000-podcast-clip">[00:00:00] Podcast clip</h3>

<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> There‚Äôs a product that I used very frequently and it had one of the greatest features that if you will, beat out all the other competing products in that market space.</p>

<p>I got a very close relationship with the developers, and they kept talking about how difficult it was to maintain that feature, which I totally understand.</p>

<p>And what they did was they buried the feature.</p>

<p>[00:00:23] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> And then said, no one‚Äôs using it!</p>

<p>[00:00:24] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And then said, no one‚Äôs using it, exactly.</p>

<p>[00:00:26] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> I‚Äôve seen that. I‚Äôve seen that as well from a company I won‚Äôt name. And it was like, oh, you‚Äôre just trying to kill this and you‚Äôre using the metrics as the reason to kill it. And, but it‚Äôs completely unfair and not customer centric.</p>

<h3 id="000039-intro">[00:00:39] Intro</h3>

<p>[00:00:39] <strong>Speaker:</strong> Welcome to the Agile in Action Podcast with Bill Raymond. Bill will explore how business disruptors are adopting agile techniques to gain a competitive advantage in this fast-paced technology driven market.</p>

<p>[00:00:52] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Hi, and welcome to the podcast. Today I‚Äôm joined by Debbie Levitt, author of Customers Know You Suck: Actionable CX Strategies to Better Understand, Attract, and Retain Customers.</p>

<p>Debbie is also the founder and principal at Delta CX. Hi Debbie. How are you?</p>

<p>[00:01:09] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Hey, I‚Äôm okay. How are you doing?</p>

<p>[00:01:11] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Great. Thank you. I‚Äôm looking forward to our conversation. We talk a lot about Agile on this podcast and we cover lots of topics like psychological safety and teams, but we also talk a lot about things like frameworks like Scrum or safe or what have you.</p>

<p>And sometimes we might. Start to get a little bit too focused on the frameworks and the actions that we need to perform and we forget a little bit about the customer So we‚Äôre going to talk about returning to agility by leading with the customer. And before we get started, could you introduce yourself a little bit?</p>

<p>[00:01:44] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And thanks again for having me on. I‚Äôm Debbie Levitt. My company is Delta cx. I‚Äôve been working in CX and UX for decades, and, I‚Äôm a researcher, a, an information architect, a designer, a strategist. I am not an artist. I‚Äôm really that person who comes at the customer experience from the from, from the angle of, behavior and customer needs and making sure we‚Äôre doing the right things for them while balancing that with what the business is trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>So typically I‚Äôm doing, research projects or sometimes consulting with companies to help them improve some of this customer centricity stuff, especially when people feel like it‚Äôs working against Agile or agile works against it. It‚Äôs not playing nicely, teams aren‚Äôt playing nicely. So that‚Äôs, some of the stuff I do.</p>

<p>And thank you for mentioning my new book. Customers Know You Suck, which is a, how to manual for customer centricity.</p>

<p>[00:02:41] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> It‚Äôs a catchy title.</p>

<p>[00:02:42] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p>[00:02:43] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I like to start the podcast with this general question: could you share what Agile means to you?</p>

<p>[00:02:49] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Yeah, that‚Äôs a wonderful question and something I have been thinking about lately, in fact. I think about. agile being a few different things. I think about it being a system or paradigm or framework, to help usually engineers or people in en engineering roles, improve their efficiency, improve their velocity, make sure they‚Äôre delivering more value to users and customers and partners and everybody in our ecosystem.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm old enough to remember the waterfall days. I remember the project that took a year and a half and we hope someone likes it. I think of Agile as being a way to work more efficiently in those smaller pieces and hopefully being more about testing and learning and doing the right thing, as we go.</p>

<p>I always have the Agile manifesto principles swimming around my head, so I think about our highest priority being to satisfy the customer. and it can be through continuous delivery of working software, but I think we might not all agree on what working means.</p>

<p>To me it has to go far beyond does it somewhat function. It‚Äôs got to be the right thing to solve the right problem for the right set of users. I think about all the Agile manifesto principles. I know some people feel like they‚Äôre outdated or old or oh, that‚Äôs decades ago, but I think there‚Äôs a lot of good intentions in there that a lot of companies aren‚Äôt really following through on that. I think the core of Agile, has a lot of great ideas and approaches, and then the implementation to me, always makes me want to, I don‚Äôt know, drown my sorrows in some decaf coffee.</p>

<p>[00:04:28] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Let‚Äôs talk about that then. We are going to be building products at this rapid pace and we‚Äôre going to get our product out there to the customer as quickly as possible, but what are some of the challenges that we see with that?</p>

<p>[00:04:40] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Yeah, it‚Äôs so funny. You know, when I think about all the things we hear growing up, we hear slow and steady wins the race, and we have all of these, parables and things that we say to ourselves and children and society, and families about, take your time. Do it right. I think about songs we heard on, children‚Äôs TV shows, and then we get to our modern day and Agile and it‚Äôs no faster.</p>

<p>Or you‚Äôre going that fast. Go even faster. You what you estimated a five, make it a three. and I think we‚Äôve turned into what I call speed over quality because it, I have, I‚Äôm certainly not against, moving quickly. I‚Äôm certainly not against, trying to do things more efficiently. But I do feel like the pursuit of that has made us lose focus on the quality as perceived by the customer.</p>

<p>We very often justify quality with, engineering or development terms or QA terms. Like, Hey, is this code, documented, deployable,does it meet our definitions of ready or done or wherever we are in the process? Well, then it‚Äôs quality must. Be good, but nobody, or I don‚Äôt wanna say nobody, that‚Äôs a little harsh, but I feel like the vast majority of people are not asking enough questions about did we build the right thing for the real target audience?</p>

<p>Was this a stakeholder ego project? Are we chasing the wrong metrics or KPIs? Are we doing things that are deceptive or possibly unethical? Did we make someone‚Äôs life better today? Or is this just another product that we‚Äôre going to want to uninstall or throw out the window? Because I think we‚Äôve all, we all know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a poor product or software or experience.</p>

<p>We all know what that feels like. We hate when it‚Äôs done to us, we can tell we, oh, this company didn‚Äôt care, this company didn‚Äôt, whatever, and then we go to work and then we do the same things. And so I think we have to. Cut the cycle of mediocrity and I can‚Äôt find anything in Agile that says, and maybe I just missed something, but I can‚Äôt find anything that says, whatever you do, don‚Äôt spend a little more time to be better.</p>

<p>Just go as fast as you can. We talk about lean, and Lean is about, it‚Äôs not about going as fast as you can. Traditional Lean was about removing defects and being more efficient because we have better internal processes and we‚Äôre creating more quality for customers and users with fewer defects.</p>

<p>And so I‚Äôm maybe a bit too traditional or too purist, but these are the things I believe in.</p>

<p>[00:07:09] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I think those are great beliefs to stand by because I was just thinking about, a customer that I was recently talking to and they were bringing up an issue where they were saying that the developers were moving quickly, but the customer was not testing as much as they needed them to. So therefore to give them feedback and say whether or not this was a good product. And it turned out that the customer, this is all internal, right? This is a company building software,their internal IT department building software for their customer. And one of the interesting things was I went back to the customer and they said they‚Äôre asking for too much of our time.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre we, we‚Äôve a, we‚Äôve appointed this person gets to spend about 20% of their time reviewing the code, and so we can‚Äôt provide you anymore. And so I‚Äôm saying, this person, you have an organization of over 150 people. That are gonna be using this tool when it‚Äôs done and you have a person spending 20% of their time using it, this should be going out to almost everyone and you should be getting more feedback and you need to have that feedback loop in place.</p>

<p>And it just really rang true what you just said. I mean it, even if we as engineers want the customer feedback, if we‚Äôre not all working together as a team to do the best that we can, then maybe the work that we‚Äôre doing just shouldn‚Äôt even be done.</p>

<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> And of course that‚Äôs Agile Manifesto. Principle number 10. I think, one of my favorites and I just made a couple of notes. While you‚Äôre talking and I was thinking, for a client like that, I would be asking them, how do you measure success? Because when this product gets deployed, in that enterprise environment, how will we know that we were successful?</p>

<p>Were we looking for people to get more done in a day or do a certain task in a shorter amount of time? Or are we looking for fewer errors because maybe the old way of doing it was riddled with mistakes. How are we going to measure success? Because then we would be able to say to that person, then what‚Äôs the risk?</p>

<p>What‚Äôs the risk that we don‚Äôt test this enough now? And when we deploy this ends up not meeting your standards or metrics or goals for success. And someone declares this project a failure or, a mini disaster or not successful, will this have been worth it? So I think that these are some tough conversations that we have to have with people, especially about how we‚Äôre gonna measure success and all the risk.</p>

<p>And, and one of my favorite things from Lean Six Sigma, the costs of poor quality.</p>

<p>[00:09:36] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I just shared a story about the customer not being as focused on the results as they need to be, but we have the reverse as well. Sometimes there are teams that are doing the software development, building the product or whatever that product might be, and they say they‚Äôre customer focused, but Curious, what are some signs that maybe you‚Äôre, you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre customer focused, but</p>

<p>it may not be, the way you might define it?</p>

<p>[00:10:04] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Yeah, there‚Äôs definitely some things that you can see while you‚Äôre either in that concept phase or in the development phase. If it makes it that far. One thing that we can take a look at is,what is the problem we‚Äôre solving? Let‚Äôs start with is there a problem statement? Is there a known user or customer pain point?</p>

<p>Are we really solving something for the customer? Very often we‚Äôre not. Very often we‚Äôre in feature factory mode and we say, wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if everybody got a pink fly swatter, Hey, just make them a pink fly swatter. They‚Äôll, they‚Äôll use it. they‚Äôve got flies and so we wanna make sure that we have identified real user or customer pain points or problems that are either opportunities for us to improve a current product or rethink it, reinvent it, invent something new, innovate where possible. So that‚Äôs one thing. Can we tie our work to a customer problem and not something that was reverse engineered later? I sometimes see these user stories where it was very clear that there really wasn‚Äôt a use case for whatever this feature is, and it‚Äôs somebody‚Äôs pet project, and so somebody‚Äôs writing these user stories that make it sound somebody will want it. I always like to joke, as a user I need a giant cup the size of my head, so that I can insert user story ending there a nd. You know that might not be the right solution and there might not be a real problem there. Maybe every customer has a cup that they already like.</p>

<p>So I know these are kind of silly examples, but I think one thing is, can we even tie our work to something that is a real problem or opportunity from the customer‚Äôs perspective, not just from the business‚Äôs perspective. So some tough questions to ask ourselves and our teammates.</p>

<p>[00:11:50] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yeah, and I have a great example of that because I‚Äôm a little frustrated with the product that I‚Äôm using right now. I‚Äôm not going to say the name of it, but. I do write frequently and in order to,do my writing, I like to make sure that everything is grammatically correct. And of course, we always misspell words, don‚Äôt put the comma in the right place and things like that.</p>

<p>And so I have this tool that I‚Äôve been using, since I can remember that just continues to add all these capabilities to help me make sure that I‚Äôm speaking in the right voice and things like that. And it‚Äôs a great product. They decided that, because of this whole AI ChatGPT thing, they were just gonna throw that tool in there.</p>

<p>One of the things that‚Äôs important to me is when I write, it‚Äôs in my voice. people like the way I write, people read my articles because of the style that I have, I like to think, and what I did was I was writing this thing and I said, I could. I could use some help. I could use some, like some something, someone to bounce some ideas off of.</p>

<p>And of course, what do you do? You just copy and paste a little of text, throw it into something like ChatGPT, and it says, here‚Äôs another way that you might think about it. Perfect. And then I can go back and, I‚Äôve just bounced my idea off an AI. That‚Äôs cool. But now what they‚Äôve done is they incorporated that right into the tool.</p>

<p>And so when I selected the text and said, now give me a recommendation for how I could improve this, I. It replaced all the stuff I wrote with its own AI generated text. It doesn‚Äôt look or sound like me, and I‚Äôm going, you just did this because you have to put AI on everything now. You didn‚Äôt do this to actually help me with my writing.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre doing this as a way to replace my content, which is not anything that I would ever purchase that product for.</p>

<p>[00:13:35] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Gosh, I‚Äôm so with you on that. I feel like we‚Äôre so bombarded with all of these fake AI, machine learning types of features, and it‚Äôs definitely the feature factory in effect. And I‚Äôve seen this as well, I posted on LinkedIn recently about, the App I used to email on my Android phone, decided, oh, we‚Äôre gonna add, an AI capability, write a prompt, we‚Äôll write your email for you. Now, I am not a big lover of the whole ChatGPT, write stuff for you right now. I feel like it‚Äôs not giving me what I want, so it doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not a match for me, but I figured try it, be surprised.</p>

<p>So just for fun, for the prompt. And again, you‚Äôre gonna say, well, that‚Äôs not a good prompt. And I go, uh, UX, I should be able to put in whatever I‚Äôm thinking if it really is that smart. So I just wrote. Can‚Äôt wait to see you just to see what email it would write for me. And I assumed my, I dunno what your assumption would be, but my assumption was I was gonna get a short email, Hey, can‚Äôt wait to see you.</p>

<p>Looking forward to getting together, you know, something like that. It wrote four paragraphs and it made up a life for me that I‚Äôm not living. It sounds so much like your story. It was like, I‚Äôve really been enjoying a lot of good movies and books lately, and I‚Äôm sure you have too, and I can‚Äôt wait to hear about them.</p>

<p>And I‚Äôm thinking, I haven‚Äôt read a book in years and I hate going to the movies. I just watched Ryan George‚Äôs pitch meetings on YouTube. and it invented this life for me that I don‚Äôt even have, and it was. Four paragraphs and as you pointed out, didn‚Äôt sound like me. And someone said,it‚Äôs the prompt that you put in.</p>

<p>And I said, I just wanted a very simple, can‚Äôt wait to see you email, but the one that‚Äôs really boggling my mind is an online event system that I use, who I won‚Äôt name, decided to throw AI into their online event system. But how are they doing it? Every time I log in, now I get a popup saying, we now have an AI event namer, do you need help? Naming your event, and I‚Äôm thinking out of all the event help you possibly could have given me, I already had a name for my event that‚Äôs done. I‚Äôm I‚Äôve got that. What else do you have? Nope. We‚Äôre AI event naming and it‚Äôs a popup every time I log in. So yeah, I think we have to ask ourselves.</p>

<p>Are we building what users need? How do we know it‚Äôs what users need? It can‚Äôt just be cool. It can‚Äôt just be interesting. It can‚Äôt just be different. We can‚Äôt pretend we‚Äôre innovative. I think we have to ask ourselves, would the user have chosen this for themselves? And certainly in your story, I can‚Äôt imagine someone saying, I sure hope AI replaces everything I‚Äôve just written with its own text.</p>

<p>[00:16:07] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I know we‚Äôre just talking about some AI situations, but of course I think anyone that‚Äôs used a software product in their lives have watched the product kind of shift from the thing that was really useful and helpful to them, to something that is no longer useful and help helpful to them.</p>

<p>Or is too many buttons to click to get something done. Yeah. The bloat.How do we refocus that so that we‚Äôre making sure that we are. Meeting the demands of our customer.</p>

<p>[00:16:33] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Yeah. To me there‚Äôs two main parts of our larger project life cycle where we need to be connecting with customers. There‚Äôs the very, very beginning of the project, and this is the research teams love to skip because they think we don‚Äôt need that. We‚Äôre going to do build, test, learn. We‚Äôre just gonna take an idea, we have build it, we‚Äôll put it out there and we‚Äôll learn from that.</p>

<p>But usually that leads to small cycles of small changes and, or sometimes nothing at all. Cuz we say we‚Äôll fix it later and then we don‚Äôt. But, the early research really sets the whole project up for success because what do we know? Very often our teams are working from guesses and assumptions. We assume a user would like AI to replace all of their information.</p>

<p>We assume users want to drink out of a one liter cup. Hey, this will be great. So we need that early research, and that‚Äôs best done with professional qualified researchers observing people, and the task, the way they do it now, which it should or could be outside of your ecosystem, it‚Äôs not about watching how they use your tool.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs later in what we call a evaluative research, but early we call it generative research. Some people call it discovery, but remember, it‚Äôs not to discover who likes your crappy idea and try to shoehorn that in. It‚Äôs really about discovering people behaviors, as we like to say on my YouTube channel.</p>

<p>People. Systems and context. These are the things that we want to know more about so that this can better guide our strategies, our decisions, our products and services. So that‚Äôs the first time where we should really be working with target audiences, some who might be customers and some who fit the model or the segment, but aren‚Äôt we always learn more from people who could be our customers but aren‚Äôt. And then there‚Äôs the evaluative testing, which is best still during that CX or UX process. Where now that we have a prototype, a concept, something like that, before engineers burn time on it, I want to test my prototype again with archetypal users.</p>

<p>Some might be current users. Always better to use non-users or customers who fit your target audience because the current users. They know the system. They‚Äôre savvy, they know the workarounds. They‚Äôre used to the terrible thing you‚Äôve built. So best to get those fresh eyes. And that‚Äôs where we can see, some people think that, uh, UX testing or user testing or usability testing, whatever they‚Äôre calling it, they think it‚Äôs, is this good enough to build and ship.</p>

<p>But what we should really be looking for at that time is did we solve the original problem? And that‚Äôs again, where we tie it back to some sort of opportunity to make something better for our users. Did we solve that problem? And then when we watch them, it‚Äôs really more of an observational study when we watch them in the prototype or an early dev build before it‚Äôs released to the public.</p>

<p>Did we solve that problem? And is this easy, logical, intuitive? Does it make sense? If someone is saying stuff like, we‚Äôll need to put more instruction text on here, or, hey, this is gonna need some tool tips and tutorials. We failed because a lot of people, the companies we admire most, you take it out of the box, you turn it on and you go, I get it.</p>

<p>It just works. And that‚Äôs what you expect from the companies you do business with. You don‚Äôt wanna read a manual, you don‚Äôt wanna take their training. You wanna say, I can figure this out. Nobody wants to feel non-intelligent. So these are key points where we have to interface with users, or archetypal users before this ever goes live.</p>

<p>Because if this idea crashes and burns while we‚Äôre still in that CX or UX phase, the cost to, to change this, is very little. It‚Äôs gonna cost us some time and some money, but not as much as if we really build this and put it out there and then find out we didn‚Äôt solve the right problem, we solved the problem poorly.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a real match to our users. Now the costs are off the charts and it‚Äôs where people start sweeping things under the rug and saying, we‚Äôll fix it later, and it‚Äôs good enough. And they‚Äôll just call customer support because we don‚Äôt build customer support costs into our budget. So we think we can just pass our problems down the line.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs so many things that we can hear ourselves saying at our jobs every day that should really be red flags and important moments for us to look at what agility is supposed to be. It‚Äôs supposed to be these empowered teams who can say, wait a minute, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre doing the right work right now. Let‚Äôs talk about this. I don‚Äôt wanna wait two weeks for a retro, let‚Äôs talk about this now.</p>

<p>[00:21:19] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Now I hear everything that you‚Äôre saying. Let me share with you a counterpoint that I hear quite frequently, where, they say yes, CX, customer experience, user experience, UX is very important to us. And what they do is they bring the team together and they‚Äôre starting off the journey of building this new customer solution and they do all that work that you talked about, that sort of phase of work where you‚Äôre defining what you‚Äôre trying to do and meeting with the customer and things like that. And it works really well and we watch it happen. And when we have retrospectives and meet up as a team and say, what‚Äôs going well?</p>

<p>And it‚Äôs like this is the part that‚Äôs really helping us get excited about the product because the customer‚Äôs already excited. We just showed them, a screenshot and a PowerPoint of what this might look like, and they‚Äôre, and they can‚Äôt wait to get their hands on it. So you know that you‚Äôre getting, you‚Äôre going somewhere.</p>

<p>But then what happens is you start developing the product suddenly you start to see the customer experience and user experience, people seem to get pulled off of the team. Now the developers can take that code and start building, and now they have a backlog of work.</p>

<p>And we see the shift away from that sort of regular defining what the customer needs are. How do we make sure that we don‚Äôt shift away from that and lose that focus?</p>

<p>[00:22:41] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> It‚Äôs a fantastic question and thank you for saying all of that great story too. And, and the way that I see it is it‚Äôs really this push pull that I‚Äôve experienced where Agileists or agile coaches, or Scrum Masters or whoever might be involved will say, we really want these UX people embedded. We want them a hundred percent on our project.</p>

<p>We want them all the time. We want researchers, we want, designers, we want, writers, we want all the people available to us all the time. But then what happens is, whoever is in charge of the project from a budgetary perspective says, these people are just a line on the budget and we can‚Äôt wait until they are off this budget.</p>

<p>Okay, UX needs, three weeks, four weeks, two sprints, nine sprints, whatever it is. I‚Äôm just making up numbers right now. UX needs x. Okay, budget for that and done. And then what happens is, especially when a company uses what we sometimes call an internal agency model, the UX team says, hey, we don‚Äôt need you anymore we got stuff in the backlog. I heard this all the time when I worked at Macy‚Äôs as a senior UX architect. Hey, that‚Äôs fine. We got your designs and they‚Äôre in the backlog, and you can leave our project now never to be seen again. And that doesn‚Äôt make sense. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for what I think Agile is supposed to be.</p>

<p>It certainly doesn‚Äôt make sense for good teamwork and collaboration. And I think there‚Äôs so many more points where we can continue working with the developers. So UX would be working with developers, especially when there‚Äôs ambiguities or questions or, Hey, what happens if the person‚Äôs phone explodes while this, whatever.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs always going to be some question best if the designer can answer that and say, oh, in this case this should happen. When the designer‚Äôs not there, the engineers start making stuff up and playing designer, and sometimes they make great things and unfortunately, too often they make not great things.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs just not their expertise. And so I think we have to stop treating, our CX or UX practitioners as some line on the budget that we can‚Äôt wait to make smaller and smaller. And if Agile is serious about saying, we want these people embedded, we want them as part of the team, we want them, whatever.</p>

<p>I remember, gosh, I remember. Back at Macy‚Äôs was co-location. we wanna be smelling distance from you. I was like, I dunno about that. But,I love the remote work thing, so I don‚Äôt think we need the co-location. We can fight about that another time. But,</p>

<p>I would love to see five UX people completely dedicated to, let‚Äôs just call it an agile team. And that way you have enough people to be agile. But at many companies, you get one third of one person. You get no researchers, you get a designer 30% of the time or for four weeks, and then they‚Äôre gone. And then everyone‚Äôs mad at everybody else.</p>

<p>And so I think that we have to, look at UX or CX as a permanent member of that team or hopefully five permanent members of that team and not just as some passing consultant, because I also find what happens is people act like, ah, UX is easy. I can do it. I‚Äôll call them if I need help, but I‚Äôm pretty good at this.</p>

<p>And unfortunately, usually people are not as good as UX as they think. It‚Äôs in kind of tip of the iceberg thing where people think UX is much easier than it is. They see us make wire frames or prototypes and they think I can do that too. And okay, tunes this, the cat can drive, but not very well. These are some of the concerns that I have, and I think it just comes down to budget. we have to budget for UX people to join the team and stay on the team, especially post-release monitoring. That‚Äôs where our research and interaction with customers have to come back. Analytics might not tell us everything.</p>

<p>Surveys might not tell us everything. We‚Äôve gotta keep, observing customers and it‚Äôs best when the qualified researchers do that.</p>

<p>[00:26:25] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I hear you. There‚Äôs actually a product that I used very frequently over the course of many years, and it had one of the greatest features that if you will, beat out all the other competing products in that market space. And that‚Äôs the one reason for why I used it, was because of this one feature.</p>

<p>And I got a very close relationship with the developers, and they kept talking about how difficult it was to maintain that feature, which I totally understand. And what they did was they started burying the feature in the product so you couldn‚Äôt find it easily. And then I. I heard rumors that they‚Äôre going to remove the feature completely.</p>

<p>And I said, why are you doing that? And they said, well, our customer telemetry data, or,for folks that may not know what that is, when you run the software, usually the software‚Äôs collecting every button you press and everything you do. And they look for things that you‚Äôre using and that you‚Äôre not using.</p>

<p>And what they did was they buried the feature,</p>

<p>[00:27:23] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> And then said, no one‚Äôs using it!</p>

<p>[00:27:24] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And then said, no one‚Äôs using it, exactly.</p>

<p>[00:27:26] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> I‚Äôve seen that. I‚Äôve seen that as well from a company I won‚Äôt name. And it was like, oh, you‚Äôre just trying to kill this and you‚Äôre using the metrics as the reason to kill it. And, but it‚Äôs completely unfair and not customer centric. So I‚Äôm with you on that one.</p>

<p>[00:27:41] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> So this comes down to accountability, doesn‚Äôt it?</p>

<p>[00:27:43] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Holy cats, how much time do we have to talk about accountability? Oh, I‚Äôm just on fire about accountability right now. yeah, I think that accountability is ultimately the root of. cause of a lot of our problems because I‚Äôve been on so many teams over the years and I keep hearing, this person‚Äôs gonna be accountable, this person‚Äôs gonna be responsible.</p>

<p>Usually, usually it was a product manager, not necessarily. And then when there was carnage and disaster and everything went wrong and blah, blah, blah, nothing seemed to happen. I was like, then what is accountability? What is being responsible? What does it mean if we have a project that fails in a small or large way, who‚Äôs accountable and what does that look like?</p>

<p>And it‚Äôs even reflected in some of the news we‚Äôve seen over the past year. All of these executives coming out and saying, oh, we‚Äôve had to lay these people off and I hold myself responsible. Slow, sarcastic clap. what does that mean? did you take less pay this year? Most of them did not.</p>

<p>What does that mean? And I don‚Äôt want people to think that, I believe that accountability means you do something not great and we fire your butt immediately. There‚Äôs a lot of things that can happen between A and B, and so I, I think that accountability means responsibility and it means there are consequences.</p>

<p>There are rewards and there are consequences. I haven‚Äôt seen any consequences at any of the places where I‚Äôve worked or consulted. And at times I‚Äôve seen the person who created the most problems lauded and promoted and it was like, what do you, what is the message here? What‚Äôs your company values again?</p>

<p>Cause I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôre living them. So I think that, accountability would fix a lot of stuff. I think it would give engineers more time. I think it would give engineers more human power because in instead of trying to drive these people to work themselves to death and just be faster and faster, robots, someone might actually care about their mental health.</p>

<p>Someone might care about their work life balance. Someone might care about all of this and say, wow, we need to add another person to that team, or whatever the case may be. If there were more accountability around CX and UX, maybe other people would stop trying to do my job and doing it so incredibly poorly. Because then they might be held accountable later.</p>

<p>Hey, the product manager came up with this idea and made their own wire frames and wow, this super tanked. Slow, sarcastic clap. Okay. Thank you. Can you please not do my job again? Can someone please bar you from trying to be a UX designer? This ain‚Äôt your thing. So I think that there are things that can be done with oversight and governance and budgeting.</p>

<p>We could put some of these people on a performance improvement plan, which some people think is harsh and terrible, but usually they love to put others on a performance improvement plan. So what‚Äôs good for the goose, perhaps. But I think that if we had more of this accountability both at the individual level and at the team level, then things have to get better for all of us. I‚Äôm not sure things are great for any of us a at many of the jobs that, that we‚Äôre at. You‚Äôll see more of this than I will, I‚Äôm sure, but I just am not seeing that accountability and sure it‚Äôs okay to make mistakes. It‚Äôs okay to fail fast though it‚Äôs best when it‚Äôs still behind the scenes and a UX prototype and not something we release to the public that we have to undo. But where is that accountability? Because I would love to be held accountable at a job. I would love for someone to say, Hey, Deb, that that design needed didn‚Äôt work out, and I would say, awesome.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs talk about how I was given two days. When I asked for two weeks, or let‚Äôs talk about how I needed to test it a second round. And I was told, we don‚Äôt need to test these things. We‚Äôre just gonna put ‚Äòem out to the public and see how they do. I would love to be held accountable. I would love for someone to say to me. Your design didn‚Äôt do as well as we‚Äôd hoped.</p>

<p>Why is that? And I could go, here‚Äôs all of the decisions other people made that blocked me from doing better work. Agile Manifesto principle number five, give motivated individuals the time and then resources they need to do their work and trust them to do their jobs. I would love to have that. I would love to have those conversations.</p>

<p>I would love to talk about it in retro and then see someone act on it. Wow, the UX was really bad when we gave those people two days. Maybe we need to talk to them about how much time they need to do better work, et cetera.</p>

<p>[00:32:12] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> It sounds like you‚Äôre passionate about that.</p>

<p>[00:32:14] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> For sure. Fire!</p>

<p>[00:32:15] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> we‚Äôre getting very close to the end of the podcast. You shared a lot of very useful information here and I am curious, I. sometimes I think when we, look at all these things that you‚Äôre proposing here, which seem very reasonable and natural to me, I did of course hear some words that might scare, if you will, teams that are always shipping and moving fast.</p>

<p>Such as saying you might need two weeks instead of two days, and things like that. So if I‚Äôm a leader and I wanna bring some of these ideas and concepts into the organization, but I‚Äôm also worried about things getting slowed down by bringing this, uh, UX and CX ideas and concepts into the team.</p>

<p>What are some things that I can do to make sure that, we‚Äôve reached some sort of a good balance?</p>

<p>[00:33:04] <strong>Debbie Levitt:</strong> Yeah. For starters, the, that team leader or project manager or program manager in the very earliest stages has to be talking with CX and UX. workers or leaders there, because I find that a lot of times projects are being planned and I know nothing about them. Nobody has talked to anybody in UX. No one has said, Hey, UX, how much time do you need to do great work?</p>

<p>Good work, mediocre work? The fastest crap you can spit out. These are conversations that we could have and we often don‚Äôt. What typically ends up happening, especially with our UX architects or designers, is someone says, Hey, we‚Äôve planned out all these projects or the whole release and hey UX, you‚Äôre gonna get two days and get me those final wire frames or prototypes, and I‚Äôm going.</p>

<p>Wait, I just heard about this. Why didn‚Äôt anyone come and talk to me? So I think again, if we, especially if we want to have that team spirit and especially where we want our UX peeps to feel like they are part of the team, maybe even embedded or dedicated, they have to be part of that early planning as well.</p>

<p>And I think ultimately, while sometimes days or week or two weeks is very scary to people. And they go, what? Two weeks? And I go, that‚Äôs funny you‚Äôve got what, 6, 8, 10 engineers who want to work on something for two sprints, three sprints, four sprints, some that‚Äôs agile. Somehow six to 10 people working on stuff for weeks is agile.</p>

<p>But when UX wants a few more days, or God forbid, a couple of weeks, holy cats, people just explode and they go, that‚Äôs not agile. And I say, look, it absolutely can be. We just have to make sure we‚Äôve planned for it. We, you can have that engineering team working on project. A, and your UX researchers are now researching for Project B, and then your UX designers are working on Project B while the devs are still building Project A and building it and testing it and merging it and deploying it.</p>

<p>They‚Äôve got plenty to do. Don‚Äôt do. I love when people tell me, what are our engineers gonna do while UX takes all this time? First of all, you have other projects you‚Äôve gotta do and we can start our stuff early. Second of all, I‚Äôve never met an engineering team that had nothing to do. There‚Äôs always something in the backlog or the ice box or, The to-do list or the stakeholder ego trip, there‚Äôs always something we could do.</p>

<p>How‚Äôs our performance? Do we need to refactor something? So I don‚Äôt want to hear what will our engineers do you have things to do? I just know it and again, this is just all about good planning while the engineers are still working on project A, we are already researching, designing, testing, improving, iterating on B and then if we‚Äôve planned this, well, UX will be ready when engineering is done with a, Hey, guess what? We‚Äôre ready. But of course there‚Äôs collaboration along the way. I don‚Äôt believe in just, Hey, here‚Äôs our design. Nice to meet you. There should be, there will be collaboration in all directions along the way, but I think that‚Äôs the main message I would give people is stop being afraid of words like days and weeks.</p>

<p>These are not scary words, and somehow engineers can get that time. We should as well, and it just has to be planned for.</p>

<p>I really appreciate this conversation today. Debbie Levitt, if anyone wants to reach out to you, how might they be able to do that?</p>

<p>Yeah, thanks for asking. Um, they can certainly find me at customercentricity.com, which is my new website still um, putting that together in some ways and, uh, that‚Äôs got more information on, on what we do and how to find me.

I know you don‚Äôt give out email addresses here, but really anyway that people are comfortable getting in touch with me I‚Äôm always happy to answer further questions. cuz I know there‚Äôs a lot of mystery around how CX and UX and Agile can all be buddies.</p>

<p>Yeah, there certainly is, and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre doing this whole series to uncover what CX and UX means and customer centric delivery, and I really appreciate the time that you spent. Thank you, and I forgot to mention my YouTube channel. deltacx. Sorry.</p>
