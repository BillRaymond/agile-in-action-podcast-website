<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Hi, and welcome to the Agile in Action podcast. My name is Bill Raymond and today Iâ€™m joined by Captain Jon Haase. H ello, Jon. How are you today?</p>

<p>[00:00:07] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Iâ€™m great Bill. Thanks. How you doing?</p>

<p>[00:00:09] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Great. Thank you. Iâ€™m looking forward to the conversation.</p>

<p>[00:00:12] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Captain Jon Haase, you are in the Navy as a program manager at the Expeditionary Missions Program Office, or PMS 408 in NAVSEA. Along with your service and campaign awards, you have been honored with the Heroic Service Bronze Star Medal. Captain Jon Haase is active in promoting AI readiness and innovation with the defense sector emphasizing the importance of integrating AI technologies to enhance team efficiency and operational capabilities.</p>

<p>[00:00:42] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Your insights reflect a deep understanding of both the technical and strategic aspects of military operations in the modern era. You are qualified as an acquisition professional, program manager, level three, fully joint qualified, and explosive ordinance disposal officer.</p>

<p>[00:00:59] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> [00:01:00] Today, weâ€™re going to be talking about the role of Agile and AI to design robotics prototypes in the federal government in regulated environments. First of all, I want to thank you for your service, along with everyone on your team and the Navy for ensuring our continued safety. And while I did share a little bit about your service, could you share some additional detail related to the type of work that you do and why?</p>

<p>[00:01:24] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Yeah. Thanks Bill. I appreciate that. And thank you for inviting me on today. Itâ€™s an honor to be with you. And first of all, you know, we had a quick chat before the podcast began, and you mentioned that youâ€™ve got some family who are veterans as well from the Navy. So thank you for their service, I hope you pass that along.</p>

<p>[00:01:39] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Right now I am a Program Manager managing the cost, schedule, and performance of a number of different programs that are designed to give the Navy additional capability for future requirements.</p>

<p>[00:01:49] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> What that means is I get to look at everything from developing prototypes, to testing these prototypes, to actually fielding these and starting to get feedback from sailors who are [00:02:00] using them. I work with some of the finest professionals in the federal service, thatâ€™s active duty and federal employees as well.</p>

<p>[00:02:07] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And itâ€™s just a great honor to be part of that system to look at whatâ€™s available today, and to look at whatâ€™s coming in the future. In addition, you mentioned my service as an EOD officer, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, and just as a shout out to the larger EOD community, those are the Navyâ€™s bomb techs, whether itâ€™s under water, or on land, weâ€™re capable of finding and dealing with explosive hazards, which are some of the most interesting, talented, wonderful people.</p>

<p>[00:02:31] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Iâ€™m just privileged to be part of that community, as well. I get to serve that community in my job, as well as remain a member of that community. And itâ€™s just a privilege to be part of both those worlds.</p>

<h3 id="000240-what-does-agility-mean-to-you">[00:02:40] What does Agility mean to you?</h3>

<p>[00:02:40] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Well, thank you very much for that. And Iâ€™m looking forward to the conversation. Iâ€™m going to start with the first question I ask all of my guests, and then weâ€™re going to get into what those types of projects are. What does agility mean to you?</p>

<p>[00:02:53] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Yeah. So starting with a small question.</p>

<p>[00:02:55] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> I think agility in general to answer the broadest form of your question, is the ability [00:03:00] to observe whatâ€™s happening in the real world and respond to that in an appropriate way.</p>

<p>[00:03:05] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And the faster you can observe whatâ€™s happening and respond to it, the more agile I think you are. And generally it leads to better outcomes. So at the personal level, I think thatâ€™s implemented by being able to take in feedback from the environment, from team members, from people, from any source that it can come to you, to assimilate that into your body of knowledge and to be able to quickly make decisions and make sense of things.</p>

<p>[00:03:27] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Now, in my current role, Iâ€™m actually able to make those decisions because I have some authority in my current position where those decisions are within my scope of control. Previously in my career and in many peopleâ€™s careers, as they begin to work their way up to positions of authority where theyâ€™re making those decisions to personal levels, I think that agility looks more like recommendations.</p>

<p>[00:03:46] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> What would you recommend given what youâ€™ve learned about the real world right now, that might be different than what was known yesterday? And so I think that personal agility and really contextual decision making, being able to assimilate the information around us, rapidly come up with [00:04:00] either recommendations or guidance or decisions, is sort of the most basic level of agility that I would start with, a foundational level. Because without that teams really canâ€™t move forward, unless they have the decisions they need to, you know, from decision makers to do that.</p>

<h3 id="000414-agility-at-a-team-level">[00:04:14] Agility at a team level</h3>

<p>[00:04:14] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> The next I think is the team level of agility, which is an ability of a team, and this I usually think of as like 3 to 10 people, maybe 50 at like very, very highest end. But moving together as a small team, building a product can be really challenging. People have to build shared understanding, again, integrate all the information that everyone on the team has, and then come up with recommendations or decisions about the project theyâ€™re working on as a team. That is more challenging than sort of the individual level of agility.</p>

<h3 id="000442-agility-at-an-enterprise-level">[00:04:42] Agility at an enterprise level</h3>

<p>[00:04:42] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Then the last and most difficult level of agility, and this is just problems of scale, right? Is enterprise agility.</p>

<p>[00:04:49] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Iâ€™m making decisions as a program manager and my current job teams are coming to me with recommendations, or decisions, that Iâ€™ve delegated to them on our different products. And then if I zoom way out, you know, the [00:05:00] Navy as an enterprise is also agile and responding to what it gets from the environment around it, and following the direction of senior leaders.</p>

<p>[00:05:08] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so, I think agility is the ability to get that input from wherever itâ€™s available and to make appropriate decisions in light of that information. I think it happens at the personal, the team, and the enterprise level. And the better all of those echelons of agility work together, sort of the more harmonious the system and the better outcomes youâ€™re going to get, because youâ€™ll be making decisions based on the most accurate, relevant information.</p>

<p>[00:05:31] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And just, Iâ€™ve always admired people who can make sense of the world quickly, and come up with brilliant recommendations. And so that remains something fascinating to me at many levels.</p>

<h3 id="000540-multiple-projects-in-progress">[00:05:40] Multiple projects in progress</h3>

<p>[00:05:40] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Same here, and thatâ€™s why I created the podcast! I really appreciate that. Thank you. And now I guess itâ€™s time to move on. I guess using the term program a few times here, Iâ€™m assuming that program means that you do have multiple types of projects that youâ€™re working on. Is that correct?</p>

<p>[00:05:56] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> I do. Yeah. Iâ€™m really fortunate to have a broad array [00:06:00] of projects that I get to have teams working on and get to lead. Iâ€™ll give you maybe a quick breakdown if thatâ€™s helpful of what these look like, in terms of the context of agility. Yeah. And so these are projects that are in large part looking at current and future capabilities to provide protection to all of DOD personnel, but particularly sailors for most of our projects. We look to embrace open systems whenever possible, and thereâ€™s some standards that will follow there to help us with that. But these projects are building on open standards or at least accessible by multiple teams, from multiple companies, in order to do that.</p>

<p>[00:06:34] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> We have robotic systems, primarily. This builds distance and safety when thereâ€™s explosive hazard and someone trying to deal with it, the further away you are, the safer you are. So robots give us the best opportunity to do that. And these robotic systems are both ground based, on the water, and underwater systems, because you never know where these explosive hazards might be and where you might find them.</p>

<p>[00:06:55] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Weâ€™re moving into aerial systems a little bit more, but thatâ€™s a bit [00:07:00] more nascent for our portfolio. We also do deal with some medical capabilities, and systems, as well as some jamming capabilities that provide like a bubble of protection for folks who are using them in terms of explosive threats.</p>

<p>[00:07:12] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> These systems in total are meant to provide safety and standoff for the people using them, to assist finding, and locating these explosive hazards, which can be very tricky. And then to enable people to conduct the right procedure, at the right time, from a safe distance in order to provide safe access to wherever the US military needs to go.</p>

<h3 id="000734-ai-and-agile">[00:07:34] AI and Agile</h3>

<p>[00:07:34] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Great. Thank you for that. Thatâ€™s quite a portfolio there. I guess Iâ€™m curious, weâ€™re going to be talking about agility, and how you manage some of these efforts, but there is an AI element to this, isnâ€™t there?</p>

<p>[00:07:48] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Yeah, there is an AI element in almost all of it. And I was going to talk a little about that in my definition of agility and what it means to me, because I think weâ€™re on the cusp of something that is going to change [00:08:00] this, the pace at which we can be agile. So first of all, agility is absolutely part of these robotic systems, because when you think about a robotic system, helping you identify the first step in the process that you might go through, if there is an explosive hazard. Identification of an object is something that artificial intelligence is really good at, whether itâ€™s the computer vision based solution, whether itâ€™s multi sensors, whether itâ€™s in the underwater domain, you know, different sensors capable of processing signals under water to make sense of the underwater environment.</p>

<p>[00:08:30] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> But when you look at sensors being able to recognize patterns, this really is the strongest point for AI at the moment, so that you can build algorithms around data that you have. And because youâ€™re using stable platforms that have common sensors between the robotic systems, youâ€™re able to gather a lot of data, youâ€™re able to process, curate, clean that data, label appropriately, and once youâ€™ve done that, youâ€™ve really set the bedrock for efficient and effective artificial [00:09:00] intelligence in the form of, say, automated target recognition, which is just a fancy way to say, to be able to spot the same thing. And so, AI is at the heart of many of our robotic systems in that way.</p>

<p>[00:09:12] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> But I also think weâ€™re at the cusp of being able to move at a pace that was unprecedented before. I think that generative AI allows us to quickly research, outline, and have like a copilot, if you will, an assistant, a smart assistant with you. And the brilliance of that, and the reason that this has such a profound impact on agility for knowledge work, I think, moving forward is that what will happen as humans, then the people associated with this work will go more from generating the work, and then processing it up to more senior people to review and provide feedback to the AI assistants that theyâ€™re going to have increasingly available to them, and with increasing quality of work, sighting the references and being more and more grounded over time will quickly produce the work, and maybe many variants [00:10:00] of this work. And the people involved, which will just be as critical in the future as they are today, will be selecting the best options.</p>

<p>[00:10:08] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so when you look at the difference between generating something, creating it from scratch, versus selecting out of three or four options, which is the best, itâ€™s vastly easier to select a good input, than it is to have to create it yourself. And so what youâ€™ll do is youâ€™ll be able to have better work at a faster pace because generative AI more and more will act as a thought partner with you, right?</p>

<p>[00:10:32] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> So the person will certainly be involved in this entire process, and weâ€™re not looking in any way to remove that, but whatâ€™s happening is the role is changing. So now youâ€™re selecting the best answer instead of trying to create the best answer. I recently had a friend who was able to go to El Prado. And if you just think about looking at these masters, at these museums capturing these timeless works of art, you think how long would it take you to create something like that?</p>

<p>[00:10:54] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> You know, a lifetime. But when you look at some in a room, youâ€™re able to pick out a masterâ€™s work, right? And in the [00:11:00] same way, if youâ€™ve got generative AI working for you, youâ€™re able to pick out the work of a master, the best solutions that would come from it. And over time, I think those are going to get better.</p>

<p>[00:11:08] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so while we think in agility currently in terms of quarters, weeks, maybe days in some cases, I think weâ€™ll shift that time frame as things progress to thinking more in terms of like days and hours, and I think the possibility to unlock just-in-time solutions really begins to become a reality and a future in which everyone involved in the process has this sort of a smart assistant, right? And so Iâ€™m talking about future things, those arenâ€™t here yet. But I think the trajectory is clear. I think that has just profound implications for agility. So yeah, back to your original question, I think I has a huge impact on organizational agility, enterprise agility, and personal agility.</p>

<p>[00:11:48] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> I also think that AI, as itâ€™s being integrated into the various tools that weâ€™re producing both within my portfolio, and then others, are just making the jobs easier, safer, and of a higher [00:12:00] quality. And so I continue to look for ways to integrate AI into virtually everything that we do, because I think itâ€™s such a tailwind behind it, itâ€™s going to be such a profound change in the way that we frame problems, that we work together as a team. I think done correctly, it also humanizes work, and makes it more enjoyable, so that we can have more time to spend and talk with people, to assess the ideas that we have in front of us and have more creative options.</p>

<p>[00:12:24] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so, Iâ€™m a real optimist that itâ€™s going to bring a brighter future for all.</p>

<p>[00:12:27] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Well, I certainly resonate with that last statement that you made about the interactions, because it used to take me about 20 hours and three people to update this podcast. We worked on it very professionally, and we make sure that we deliver something thatâ€™s the highest quality that we can. And itâ€™s gone down from 20 plus hours now to about eight. And that means that I can spend more time talking to folks like yourself to improve the content that we have on our podcast, to find more [00:13:00] interesting people to interview. It takes away all the grunt work. A lot of that is because of AI right now.</p>

<p>[00:13:06] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And, you know, you sent me some notes based on an initial conversation you and I had leading up to this, and thatâ€™s another great application where AI can take a transcript, say of a meeting that you have, and can summarize the bullet points, talk about next steps and tasks, maybe even outline how you move forward with those.</p>

<p>[00:13:22] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And what that allows you to do is instead of having a person, you know, sort of having to be one person whoâ€™s just got the pen and paper out the whole time, you know, typing away the notes can actually be engaged with just a transcription, and you just bring another authentic human voice to the conversation because theyâ€™re not so tied up and just capturing the notes. And those notes, and the feedback that you get from things like that are just so valuable.</p>

<p>[00:13:44] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> So in the way Bill, that you just highlighted how itâ€™s helping speed up your podcast, I think it helps anytime thereâ€™s knowledge work with multiple parties that are generating, you know, audio that could be turned into text that can be used with AI, to really speed up [00:14:00] the process and get a better quality result.</p>

<p>[00:14:01] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so, thanks for sharing how itâ€™s helping you in the podcast, thatâ€™s really impressive. And weâ€™re looking for ways to implement that more and more in our team, every time we can find a spot.</p>

<p>[00:14:09] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Thatâ€™s fantastic. I love it. Everyone can benefit from this.</p>

<h3 id="001414-what-does-your-organization-look-like">[00:14:14] What does your organization look like?</h3>

<p>[00:14:14] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Now you talked a lot about the projects that you are working on. They sound like very complex systems, and I want to get into that, and how you manage them, and what they look like a little bit more.</p>

<p>[00:14:25] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> What does your organization look like?</p>

<p>[00:14:27] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> My organization is made up of multiple leads for programs, really separated into four key leads and a deputy. And so me and the deputy have authority over all four of those key programs. And then within each one of those key programs, I have a program lead and then several of the assistant program leads under their teams.</p>

<p>[00:14:50] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And then what happens is weâ€™re able to put on contract additional support depending on the workload at the moment and the technical skills needed. And so the technical skills to support those [00:15:00] projects can get supported in a number of different ways, thereâ€™s government folks who do that for us in many instances, thereâ€™s federally funded research and development centers that do that sometimes, and sometimes thereâ€™s just commercial companies that will hire to bring in the talent that we need.</p>

<p>[00:15:13] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> I tell the teams the same thing every time it comes to bringing in talent, whether itâ€™s hiring a federal employee, or putting someone on contract, or going to another federal agency to get the help that we need, is get the help you need.</p>

<p>[00:15:24] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Thatâ€™s so important that within that framework of how our teams are organized, that you have the technical expertise, that you have the program management expertise, the budget and finance expertise as well, because all that is some intricacies within the system that we work in. Itâ€™s challenging sometimes in some particular disciplines to get the right expertise, because theyâ€™re so in demand, and so expensive, that what you have to do is you just have to go out and find them.</p>

<p>[00:15:48] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so, you know, for us, as an example, right now, getting cloud expertise is really challenging. Some advanced AI techniques where thereâ€™s a lot of draw in the commercial world for these skills are challenging for us as [00:16:00] well. And so weâ€™re really invested in hiring the best people and bringing them onto our team.</p>

<p>[00:16:04] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And itâ€™s a great place to work. We have a fun time doing it. Federal employment is so rewarding and itâ€™s so great to see these people doing it. We have some sailors that are on our team as well. And so if youâ€™ve ever thought about joining the Navy, itâ€™s just been the most fun for me over my 23 years. I have a blast doing it.</p>

<p>[00:16:20] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And then we get some great folks who come into the team for just a project to help us out as well.</p>

<h3 id="001624-agility-and-government-contracts">[00:16:24] Agility and Government Contracts</h3>

<p>[00:16:24] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Oh, thatâ€™s fantastic. And I was just thinking about this while you were talking about, you know, bringing on contractors specifically, Iâ€™ve done a number of government contracts myself, working with the OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, and I am very familiar with responding to these types of contracts where you are enumerating all of the deliverables that are required, and when you are going to deliver those requirements, and youâ€™re here talking about agility and making sure that you are, you know, doing the right things, and it doesnâ€™t sound like [00:17:00] thereâ€™s as much focus on itâ€™s this specific deliverable, if you can do something a different way thatâ€™s better, you could go that direction.</p>

<p>[00:17:07] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And sometimes those contracts donâ€™t necessarily work that way. Is there a balance there? Is there some way where you can make sure that you can get that agility without having that strong rigor and control around the contracts?</p>

<p>[00:17:21] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Yeah, Bill thatâ€™s a really keen observation, and one that shows me that youâ€™ve had experience for sure within the contracts world, whether responding to those or on the sending side. Iâ€™ll tell you that from my perspective, thereâ€™s absolutely a balance to your question. Over specifying a contract is handcuffs, itâ€™s an unfortunate situation where once youâ€™ve over specified a requirement and over specified a contract, what ultimately is very likely to happen is that youâ€™ll learn something in the process of building it, and everybody will want to change whatâ€™s about to be delivered or will be delivered in the future.</p>

<p>[00:17:53] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And it becomes a little bit more challenging to do that. Now thereâ€™s mechanisms to do that, to achieve this agility through modifying what that [00:18:00] contractmight be with the appropriate folks from legal in the contract shop and all that stuff. And so thereâ€™s ways once youâ€™re in the development of a contract to modify those things. If youâ€™re in a good relationship with your vendor, right, those can be pretty straightforward. And if itâ€™s a challenge project, those can be, you know, that modification process can be a challenge.</p>

<p>[00:18:17] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so the best thing to do, in my opinion, is to understand the environment youâ€™re operating in first. And that might sound funny, but if youâ€™re making the same thing that happened four times previous to this contract award, and itâ€™s been a stable requirement, and you understand the work involved and thereâ€™s been no disruption to the industry thatâ€™s led up to this particular award, itâ€™s probably good to be pretty specific in terms of your dates and requirements.</p>

<p>[00:18:44] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And because you understand the environment and this is very little risk and itâ€™s having a very specified contract. If you look at some of the different acquisition pathways, there are now software acquisition pathways that are intended to provide you more flexibility, but they require [00:19:00] you to understand the environment youâ€™re operating in, and to select that pathway correctly early on in the process.</p>

<p>[00:19:06] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And if you do, thereâ€™s actually a whole world that opens up where agility is wide open to you. Itâ€™s just unusual and rare in my portfolio that itâ€™s a software only project. What tends to be more common is thereâ€™s a hardware platform, and then software that would go onto it.</p>

<p>[00:19:21] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And what Iâ€™ve found is that the companies and the teams that are best at making hardware, donâ€™t always have the strongest algorithm development teams. And sometimes donâ€™t have the best new user interface, or software teams that are working alongside of their hardware teams. And so what we found to be the best approach is to have one team thatâ€™s really focused on the hardware solution and getting something out that is functional but open enough where third parties can come in. And those third parties really hyper enable that hardware. Because their specialty are in just things weâ€™re looking for.</p>

<p>[00:19:54] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so, it becomes easier to be more specific about the hardware, right? Because [00:20:00] you need to deliver to the specification because things like size, weight, power constraints, duration, and time, these become really important requirements, because if you need your robotic system to last for five days, it needs to last a battery life and endurance for five days. Like, thatâ€™s driven by some operational requirement, and we have to be pretty firm about that in our approach to contracting.</p>

<p>[00:20:20] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> But if you look at, say, the autonomy or the AI on board, maybe thereâ€™s more flexibility for the teams, the third party teams that might be integrating those things into our platforms. And so what I think is really important is to understand the environment that each one of your teams is working on, and the nature of their projects, and then what is the cost of modifying, or updating it in the future. And in terms of hardware, itâ€™s obviously very expensive and very difficult once youâ€™ve picked a hardware architecture in order to change that in the future, once the systems are built, and then as you begin to field more and more of them, that cost and complexity just goes up. Where for software, the beauty of that is youâ€™re able to [00:21:00] change it once and update it many times.</p>

<p>[00:21:01] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so the challenges associated with having a more agile approach to software are a lot lower, right? Youâ€™re able to do it much more effectively. So I would say that the key is yes, thereâ€™s definitely a balance between the rigidity of â€“ the specificity is probably a better way to put it â€“ of the contract itself, to ensure that you get the hardware platform that you need, but then to take a more appropriate and more agile approach to the software, and the other enabling capabilities, that third parties might be bringing into that hardware platform over time.</p>

<p>[00:21:31] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And Iâ€™m increasingly thinking about agility within the modularity of the hardware itself. I think thereâ€™s been a lot of great work around modular open systems. And when I look at the future of AI on board of these systems, I like to think about the modules that power those AI systems and applications, whether itâ€™s graphics processing, GPUs, or the FPGAs, or the ASIC advanced chips that might be coming more and more in the future, how can you make those [00:22:00] easier to take out and put in over time, because increasingly, that part of the hardware will be more agile, and weâ€™ll see a lot of improvements over time. And so even thinking about like modularity at the system, and subsystem level, is something thatâ€™s really been on my mind lately.</p>

<p>[00:22:13] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Because I think if you get that right, you build in the flexibility that you need, the agility you need, after the contract has been awarded and delivered, and then for future modifications.</p>

<p>[00:22:23] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> We are kind of getting into this conversation around how you deliver these projects and these programs.</p>

<p>[00:22:29] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Itâ€™s interesting, you started off listing out some of the types of work that you do and, I can imagine that itâ€™s easy to conceive of these efforts, and imagine what they would look like, but you know, if youâ€™re sitting there looking at data and building an AI model, and youâ€™re designing these robotic systems. At some point, it goes from theory to lots of complexity because, now the robot isnâ€™t just sitting on someoneâ€™s desk recognizing an item, now it [00:23:00] has to go out into a ship, where youâ€™d have bad weather, you have ocean water, you have lots of other chaotic things that could be happening in order for these to work effectively.</p>

<p>[00:23:10] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And Iâ€™m curious, what does it look like to build one of these systems, and how do you interact with those that might end up using them?</p>

<p>[00:23:20] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Yeah. So Iâ€™ll take that into parts, the build and then the interact. So the building thereâ€™s, I tend to think of it in two big categories for my program. The first is that the commercial market space or the defense industrial base already has something thatâ€™s very close to what we want, right? We have one project where there was something very close to our requirement and we needed to change probably about 10% of the design of that project.Thatâ€™s getting something thatâ€™s very close to what you need, without having to have paid for the development. It just comes to you 90% done. Now, itâ€™s interesting when I say 90% done,if you look at like batteries, whole mechanical, electrical control systems, all the different components that make up, say, one of these robotic systems, [00:24:00] Iâ€™m saying 10% change only as I look at all the various systems and sub systems, but that 10% change might be an enormously difficult task.</p>

<p>[00:24:09] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And thatâ€™s actually what weâ€™re finding out is that, say, cybersecurity as an example, cybersecurity is critically important to all of our, itâ€™s increasingly important to everybody, if you read the news, but our systems particularly. And so a lot of times weâ€™ll have to do some of the cyber hardening for these vehicles that are, you know, 90% of what we need.</p>

<p>[00:24:26] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> We just need to add cyber hardening to them. And it turns out that when you add cyber hardening, it changes the internal communication mechanisms for many of the systems. And so youâ€™re adding what would look like a small amount in terms of like a new subsystem that does some encryption perhaps, but whatâ€™s happened is youâ€™ve changed the internal communication protocol for everything.</p>

<p>[00:24:48] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so the amount of complexity that that generates and the amount of work is actually fairly vast. And so one of the lessons Iâ€™ve learned is just because itâ€™s 90% of what you want, as like a commercial product, does not mean that that [00:25:00] last 10% is going to be easy. It could be very, very challenging as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>[00:25:04] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so thatâ€™s one thing that we have to account for when it comes to building, or fielding something thatâ€™s very close to what we want when we begin. Of course, the other way that this happens is you build it from scratch. And this is where, again, the government comes up with the design, we release a contract, and we work with the company to now build this thing.</p>

<p>[00:25:20] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And what Iâ€™ll say is that in either case, once youâ€™ve come up with a thing that works, you are still far from done, because now you have to go to environmental testing. And like you mentioned, now you have to put these things into relevant and realistic environments. And thereâ€™s shock, thereâ€™s vibration, thereâ€™s heat, thereâ€™s cold, thereâ€™s depth.</p>

<p>[00:25:40] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And ideally, you know of all these requirements ahead of time, and youâ€™ve built in something robust enough to make it through all of that. These can be really difficult to engineer something so robust that itâ€™s capable of withstanding the hottest desert heats imaginable for weeks straight, and the coldest Arctic temperatures, right?</p>

<p>[00:25:58] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so thereâ€™s been instances where weâ€™ve [00:26:00] had systems, and weâ€™ve even tested them in places like San Diego, as an example, and they do just fine. And then in order to stress them, and to gather more relevant and realistic data, we will wind up, say, taking them to Alaska and suddenly theyâ€™re introduced to a new environment.</p>

<p>[00:26:14] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Many of the environmental conditions they find themselves in are different, the objects theyâ€™re seeing are different, and they struggle to perform in this environment for the first time, these prototypes, because itâ€™s just so difficult to create a system thatâ€™s generalized across so many different environments.</p>

<p>[00:26:27] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so once youâ€™ve got a working prototype, thereâ€™s still just a ton of work to do. And youâ€™ll get to a certain point, you can never get it to perfect, youâ€™ll never bake out all the risk. Itâ€™ll take forever and youâ€™ll never field that anything if you do that, but eventually youâ€™ll get it to a point where it meets all of your requirements.</p>

<p>[00:26:42] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Itâ€™s safe and effective and you can field it. And that is a huge lift to get to that point. Itâ€™s a huge celebration for our team. Itâ€™s a wonderful time to be part of a team, when you ship a product to the Navy, itâ€™s one of the best feelings ever. But then what happens, as you alluded to, is then what, right?</p>

<p>[00:26:57] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Because many people think like, oh, itâ€™s fielded, itâ€™s [00:27:00] in the hands of sailors, our job is done. But the truth is, youâ€™ve still probably only done about 25% of the work of the entire life cycle of that product. Because now whatâ€™s going to happen is sailors are going to get it. And sailors are the most creative, incredible human beings on the planet, and they will do things with your product when it comes to a time of need or conflict to accomplish a mission that you had never imagined.</p>

<p>[00:27:25] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And itâ€™ll be the most innovative, creative, incredible thing. They will accomplish amazing feats that will move mountains. And then the report will come back to you on what they did, and you will say, we need to make it better at that thing they just discovered is useful. We didnâ€™t think about that.</p>

<p>[00:27:39] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Thereâ€™s this constant iterative feedback process where youâ€™re continuing to try to get as much feedback from as many environments, from as many sailors as possible, take all that information and improve your product.</p>

<p>[00:27:52] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> But again, that product improvement has to go through a cycle where it goes to the folks who are going to develop it. And then it has to be rigorously tested to make sure itâ€™s [00:28:00] going to meet all your standards. And once thatâ€™s all done, then you can put it back into the hands of the sailors and continue to get feedback.</p>

<p>[00:28:06] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> So the truth is, a project is never really done, be it hardware or software, especially when itâ€™s a hardware software combination package. You will always have more value to put inside of these things. And if youâ€™re listening to what sailors are doing with it, youâ€™ll always be challenged in the best way.</p>

<p>[00:28:24] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Oh, thatâ€™s great. Yeah, I can imagine that if thereâ€™s something at their disposal, even if it wasnâ€™t thought to be used a certain way, but if they know it has a certain capability, it will get used.</p>

<p>[00:28:35] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> If you look at the history, and so again, bomb disposal is my career field, and if you looked at what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan, where it was very intense in terms of the operations we were doing for bomb disposal and seeing these explosive threats. If you started at the beginning of that conflict and you looked at where we ended, I would say 70% of the advances, the innovation, and the progress that we made, were because someone in the field had a creative [00:29:00] idea, did it in the field first in a very prototype rough way to protect themselves or others, that came back to people in program management positions, and we decided to institutionalize what they had done in the field.</p>

<p>[00:29:12] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And I think the real strength of what we did there was the rapid iterative feedback cycle, and our ability to make those changes quickly. And so I think a military that has that sort of feedback cycle built in, and an acquisition process that knows how to respond to that, and weâ€™ve shown that we can do it, because thatâ€™s exactly what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan in that context, is well suited to respond appropriately to future conflicts.</p>

<p>[00:29:35] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<h3 id="002936-challenges">[00:29:36] Challenges</h3>

<p>[00:29:36] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Because a lot of these are bleeding edge technologies that youâ€™re working on, very often we have this, here in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, thereâ€™s a sort of you know, work fast and break things. If it doesnâ€™t work, then move on to something else. Iâ€™m curious how much of this work that you do is an idea where youâ€™re testing to decide whether itâ€™s going to go [00:30:00] into the field versus no, weâ€™re committed to this, no matter what.</p>

<p>[00:30:03] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Again, you have some very keen observations of, did you have my job before? This is actually really quite insightful on your part. So what happens is we have, both to answer your question directly, there are some that we say, this is going to happen, we release a contract, we award that contract and we are partnered with a company thatâ€™s going to do this. And weâ€™re committed to it. There are other instances where we say there might be many solutions out here, and perhaps we donâ€™t know the best solution ahead of time. And maybe what we should do, is maybe what we should do, is actually allow people who have something close to what we want to come in and impress us. So instead of sending us a proposal on paper, bring in your prototype. And when you bring it in, letâ€™s see how it works.</p>

<p>[00:30:43] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And weâ€™ll take a look at all the prototypes that work, or pitches about your prototypes if we have to. And based on what we see in our requirement, which weâ€™ll tell everybody ahead of time, weâ€™ll pick whateverâ€™s closest, right? And then from there weâ€™ll go to another phase of evaluation to see what we want to do in terms of production, and [00:31:00] quantities, and how well it meets our needs, and how much we need to adjust.</p>

<p>[00:31:02] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And weâ€™re in the middle of both of those types of programs right now. And so what winds up happening is, in some cases youâ€™ll be surprised at how far along these products are when they come in. And in some cases you will be surprised at how much you can accomplish with just committing to it ahead of time and releasing the contract, and working with folks to develop it.</p>

<p>[00:31:20] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> In many instances, youâ€™re able to de-risk your programs because if you think that the commercial technology is, Iâ€™m just going to use a number, itâ€™s an 8 of 10 in terms of readiness, and then you send out a commercial solutions opening, which is the mechanism we use to invite people to demonstrate for us.</p>

<p>[00:31:37] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And you realize that the commercial industry is maybe like a three or four relative to what you needed. Youâ€™ve suddenly de-risked a lot of your program, because you can validate your assumptions without having to spend a year, or two, or three, developing and working with a vendor to only realize that maybe it was more immature than what you thought at first.</p>

<p>[00:31:56] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> So this ability to evaluate things rapidly, and see where theyâ€™re [00:32:00] at, has an enormous benefit. Now, what needs to be in place for that? The foundations necessary in order for that to work is you need to have products that have already been built for, you know, oil and gas, as an example, theyâ€™re underwater looking for things all the time.</p>

<p>[00:32:13] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so there has to be something close enough in industry that could be brought in, where itâ€™s demonstratable and reasonable for your applications. And not everything that we do falls into that category, which is why thereâ€™s a mix between those two things. Iâ€™ll say that by far the easier of those two, and the faster of those two options is to tell people what you want to do, and allow them to come in and demo those things, under something like a commercial solutions opening.</p>

<p>[00:32:37] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And then pick whatever is best to breed in that regard, and move forward with whoeverâ€™s demonstrated the best performance, as opposed to saying ahead of time, weâ€™re just going to do this and weâ€™re going to commit to it. Now, the benefit of the, weâ€™re just going to do it and commit to it approach is that you can do things that, I mean, are really not imagined to this point, which is the whole reason for doing it.</p>

<p>[00:32:58] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Itâ€™s because nobodyâ€™s imagined it, brought that to market. [00:33:00] So the only way itâ€™s going to exist is if we do it. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s going to be a world in which we ever do only one, or only the other, but I think weâ€™re learning that thereâ€™s benefits to an approach thatâ€™s flexible between those two.</p>

<p>[00:33:10] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Again, depending on the sort of capability youâ€™re trying to develop.</p>

<p>[00:33:13] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Oh, thatâ€™s interesting. Youâ€™re sounding very much like, you know, many corporations that are trying to get their products or services out there faster, and they often make use of something thatâ€™s off the shelf, but then customized, youâ€™re just going to probably levels that may not be seen in the corporate world, but itâ€™s basically the same process.</p>

<p>[00:33:35] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> I was able to go to a very big software company whoâ€™s got software thatâ€™s running on probably all of our machines right now. And they said that for a product that I thought was one version of a product, they said thereâ€™s over 400 versions of that product that theyâ€™ll make because their enterprise customers require customization of their software.</p>

<p>[00:33:53] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And I was blown away to see that this major company, whoâ€™s a household name, had over 400 versions of what I thought was only one product [00:34:00] because each of their customers did exactly what you described. And this is in like the commercial software world. Hey, we want to use your product, but we need you to make the following adjustments.</p>

<p>[00:34:09] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so thereâ€™s like over 400 branches, the number of PRs necessary to maintain that, and the difficulty of managing that and the number of developers to just maintain it over time, to me, it was sort of eye opening.</p>

<h3 id="003420-future-of-ai">[00:34:20] Future of AI</h3>

<p>[00:34:20] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> weâ€™re getting towards the end of the podcast, but I do have a few last questions for you. First of all, AI, the term was coined in the 1950s</p>

<p>[00:34:28] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> and AI have been around for many years, and many parts of the government, and you even use your phone and you search for a cat that, well, thatâ€™s AI is doing that. Right?</p>

<p>[00:34:38] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Claude Chandler was making AI powered chess games a long time ago also, itâ€™s been around for a long time.</p>

<p>[00:34:42] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> It really has. But I think, thereâ€™s an event that occurred in November 2023, where everyone lit up with this light bulb of possibility, which is when ChatGPT was released. And now itâ€™s kind of out of the bag, thereâ€™s a real rushfor people [00:35:00] to get into AI and machine learning. And I think this is going to be really interesting to see where all of this goes.</p>

<p>[00:35:07] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> But youâ€™re in that perfect space to give advice to leaders to say, where should we start? Where should we be looking at AI and machine learning to improve how we do business? And what are some of the skills as a leader that I might need in order to manage some of these new frontier efforts?</p>

<p>[00:35:28] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Yeah, thanks for asking that. So first, where? Where we should be looking to integrate AI, I think is just about everywhere. I think weâ€™ll find that over time, thereâ€™s going to be tools that are AI powered in some way that are assisting us in back office operations, operations in general, production floor certainly, the production of products physical and digital goods, the writing of software, the checking of software, the penetration testing of software.</p>

<p>[00:35:52] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> I think if you look at generative AIâ€™s capability to make the sort of mundane tasks, even if HR related [00:36:00] things, whether itâ€™s, you know, taking a couple of bullet points and turning it into a, a recognition award, right? Thereâ€™s a great example, low risk use case that we could do right now. I think looking at transcriptions, and meetings, and capturing notes, like we talked about earlier is a great way to do it.</p>

<p>[00:36:14] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> So I think where should be really everywhere. And if leaders arenâ€™t asking questions now, like how can we begin to integrate AI into this thing in front of me, in a way thatâ€™s low risk, reversible, and that we prepare our workforce for right, they should be.</p>

<p>[00:36:30] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Because what will happen is AI will simply make people more efficient and effective at their work, it will remove the drudgery, I think it will increase happiness in the workplace.</p>

<p>[00:36:39] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so this is, in my mind, a way that leaders can show their concern for people by expressing: hey, where can we use AI in this thing in front of us right now to make this better for you? I think the key is to reinforce with that.</p>

<p>[00:36:52] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> I mean, Bill, to your point, this extra time, energy and effort that weâ€™ll get by removing some of the more uncomfortable or unpleasant parts of [00:37:00] your work, this will be given back to you so that you can be more creative, more connected, and we value input just as much in a world in which AI does more than we do right now, right?</p>

<p>[00:37:10] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Youâ€™re not going away, right? Thatâ€™s not the objective of this at all. So I think leaders need to really clearly communicate why theyâ€™re doing this. Thatâ€™s the first thing.</p>

<p>[00:37:18] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> The second is just really communicating that this isnâ€™t going to dehumanize work at all. And I actually had one employee who came into my office one time and said, Hey, Jon, thatâ€™s great that weâ€™re going to do all these things for AI, but are you not going to read my annual performance report? Is that what youâ€™re saying? Like, do you not care about me and my career? Oh no, no, no, not at all. I said, I care so much about you and your career that weâ€™re going to spend even more time talking about that. And Iâ€™m going to be here for you every step in the way. When youâ€™re on my team, or even when you leave. And this particular employee wound up getting a promotion not long after and leaving, and want to come into the office and saying, Hey, I really appreciated that conversation, and you taking the time. And I stayed in touch with them in their new job and honored that promise to be with them on their way.</p>

<p>[00:37:57] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> So that answers the where that we would do [00:38:00] it.</p>

<p>[00:38:00] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Now the skills necessary for leaders to really enable their teams to embrace this, to get past a fear that AI will take them out of the workforce, or marginalize them, remove their jobs and opportunities, I think you have to demonstrate good behavior.</p>

<p>[00:38:14] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so I go out of my way sometimes in team meetings, to actually pull up a screen, and if we have an AI tool that could be used in that instance, Iâ€™ll demonstrate asking or interacting with it in front of my team to get an answer. And then I will share it with my team. And Iâ€™ve had maybe a dozen people say that when they started seeing me interacting with some of the AI tools that weâ€™re using on our team, they realized their potential and they started doing it as well.</p>

<p>[00:38:38] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so there was a real sort of fear to start doing it. And I think their perception was that if I saw them using AI, Iâ€™d think they werenâ€™t doing their job. And what I was trying to show them, by modeling what I hope is good behavior, is that using AI is doing your job, and that I use it, and I expect and encourage you to use it as well, [00:39:00] coupled with your judgment, and wisdom, and experience to get the best solutions possible.</p>

<p>[00:39:05] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And so I think we should, again, back to your question, be looking as many places as we can to integrate AI to make the workforce better, faster and more fun, and produce better products that delight our customers more and more, whether those are customers in the Navy who are going to use these in times of need, or whether, you know, if theyâ€™re customers out that are paying for our products in the commercial world.</p>

<p>[00:39:25] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And I think that the skills necessary really communication and empathy, more than ever. So ironic that AI is making leaders, and their ability to connect to the workforce to send the right messages and to be reassuring more and more important, but I do think thatâ€™s really critical is the human side of things from leaders.</p>

<p>[00:39:40] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> And I think the days when leaders can be behind closed doors and not really communicate, or express intent effectively, as we begin to integrate some of these tools, those leaders will be just less and less effective. So what is going to be more effective is connecting with the workforce, spending that time to explain things, being an advocate for them and demonstrating good behavior.</p>

<p>[00:39:59] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I think [00:40:00] this is a great way to wrap up the podcast, actually. That was some really thoughtful responses there. Thank you.</p>

<p>[00:40:06] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Captain Jon Haase, if someone would like to reach out to you and discuss this topic, or others, further with you, how might they do so?</p>

<p>[00:40:12] <strong>Captain Jon Haase:</strong> Iâ€™m on LinkedIn, would welcome the conversation. Look forward to it.</p>

<p>[00:40:15] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Wonderful. And we learned about you, and your work, with an article that you wrote, jointly with Peter B. Walker, Olivia Berardi, and Valdemar Kowarski. That article is titled: â€˜Get real, Get better: a Framework for Developing Agile Program Management in the US Navy Supported by the Application of Advanced Data Analytics and AIâ€™. It is a great read. I highly recommend that you read that. I will make sure that both Jonâ€™s LinkedIn and this article are in the AgileinAction.com website for this particular podcast. And of course, if youâ€™re on YouTube watching the video, itâ€™ll be down there in the description as well.</p>
