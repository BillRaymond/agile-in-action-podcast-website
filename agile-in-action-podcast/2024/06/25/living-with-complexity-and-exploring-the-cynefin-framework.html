<h3 id="introducing-douglas-squirrel">Introducing Douglas Squirrel</h3>

<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Welcome to the Agile in Action podcast.</p>

<p>[00:00:02] I am your host, Bill Raymond. And today we are joined by Douglas Squirrel. Douglas, how are you today?</p>

<p>[00:00:07] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> I‚Äôm doing great. It‚Äôs a sunny day in England.</p>

<p>[00:00:10] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Wonderful. You are the author of Agile Conversations, and you‚Äôve been on the podcast before to talk about that with one of your colleagues. And you‚Äôre an expert in making tech teams profitable. We‚Äôre going to talk about living in a world of complexity. But before I do, I always like to ask this question.</p>

<h3 id="defining-agility-in-software-teams">Defining Agility in Software Teams</h3>

<p>[00:00:27] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> What does agility mean to you?</p>

<p>[00:00:28] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> An overused term for software teams, so I‚Äôd prefer not to use it too much where I really want people to be agile is in experimentation. I want them to find out more about the space they‚Äôre in, and software is uniquely, wonderfully placed for that, because it costs you nothing to try again.</p>

<p>[00:00:48] And what‚Äôs so sad is so many of us have a very high bar for how good our software should be, and I wish we would all put that bar right at the bottom so that we could experiment more.</p>

<p>[00:00:58] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yeah, I think that‚Äôs great advice. This is something that we sometimes just jump into. We have this idea, let‚Äôs implement that idea as opposed to let‚Äôs try out some of those concepts and make sure they work for our customer and they‚Äôre adding value.</p>

<p>[00:01:13] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> And the great thing is we can find that out quickly. And so many folks have a negative reaction to the idea that an experiment might fail. But in fact, in the quadrant we live in, that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre going to get into this complexity idea. The quadrant we live in. That‚Äôs the only option. The only thing we can do, is to do experiments, but we fool ourselves into thinking we actually know how things work and we don‚Äôt.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-to-the-cynefin-framework">Introduction to the Cynefin Framework</h3>

<p>[00:01:35] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Before we talk about complexity, obviously we want to talk a little bit about the framework that you‚Äôre going to focus this around, which is the Cynefin framework. .</p>

<p>[00:01:45] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> You‚Äôre Welsh is really good, Bill.</p>

<p>[00:01:46] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Thank you very much. I have it. I have it here spelled K U H N E V I N, which is exactly not how you‚Äôre supposed to spell it. It‚Äôs that‚Äôs my spelling to make sure I get it right, but I think it‚Äôs actually C Y N E F I N.</p>

<p>[00:02:02] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> Look, you write you, you speak. You‚Äôre perfect. You should move to Wales.</p>

<p>[00:02:05] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Okay. Perfect. That sounds good. So let‚Äôs see if you could just maybe give us an overview as to what the Cynefin framework is.</p>

<p>[00:02:13] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> I certainly can. So it was invented by a guy, guess what? He‚Äôs a Welsh guy and his name is David Snowden. Most people call him Dave and Dave had this wonderful idea when he was at IBM and he saw repeated issues coming up in his consulting work. What it basically gives you is a way of orienting yourself. It‚Äôs a way of understanding if you‚Äôre dropped onto a mountain, like Snowdon in Snowdonia in in Wales, which I think Dave may be named after a big mountain in Wales, you might say well, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm in the North face or the South face.</p>

<p>[00:02:42] I don‚Äôt know where I am. I don‚Äôt know how to go up or down. The framework gives you a way to figure out where am I and what should I be doing next. And let me explain that because you‚Äôre probably not climbing mountains, but you are dealing with problems in your product and your software that require this orientation.</p>

<p>[00:02:58] I‚Äôll illustrate. If you were trying to figure out how to deal with a vehicle that you had, you might be in several different circumstances. I‚Äôm going to give you different vehicles and you‚Äôll see how the different quadrants of Cynefin work. The quadrants are just four areas. You don‚Äôt have to worry about where they are physically.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-the-simple-and-complicated-quadrants">Exploring the Simple and Complicated Quadrants</h3>

<p>[00:03:15] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> But the lower right quadrant, is called the simple quadrant. And that‚Äôs like the car I have in my driveway and it‚Äôs an electric car.</p>

<p>[00:03:22] It has a battery. I don‚Äôt know where the battery is. I don‚Äôt know how the battery is connected to the wheels. I don‚Äôt know how the car works. All I know is I get in it. I turn the wheel, I push pedals and buttons and things, and the car takes me places. Anybody could figure that out. You don‚Äôt even need the manual.</p>

<p>[00:03:37] It‚Äôs very simple to understand what‚Äôs happening in that car. With me so far?</p>

<p>[00:03:41] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yes. Thank you.</p>

<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> Excellent. So the next quadrant is the next most complicated, and it‚Äôs called the complicated quadrant. Imagine now instead of my car, I have a Formula One car. It‚Äôs ready to go on a race at Monaco or wherever. Now if I were to climb in there, I couldn‚Äôt find the gear shift, because gear shifts in Formula One cars aren‚Äôt where they normally are.</p>

<p>[00:03:59] And figuring out even how to put fuel in it or anything like that. Completely beyond me. I wouldn‚Äôt have the first idea. However, there are people who know everything about formula one cars. There are super duper experts and I could hire Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen or one of those people I don‚Äôt follow this sport, but I could hire them and they could come to my house and they could drive the car.</p>

<p>[00:04:18] So the complicated domain is the world of experts. There are rules for what you should do. They‚Äôre not obvious or simple to people like you and me, but you can get an expert and you can follow the rules. This is the most attractive quadrant. This is the one we keep thinking we‚Äôre in because we think, gosh, how hard could this software be?</p>

<p>[00:04:36] Wait a minute. People have been building e-commerce websites all the time. I remember building one in which we had 4,000 new products every week. And it‚Äôs looked like you could just use Shopify. Boy, you could not use Shopify. Boy, that did not work. And it looked like it was complicated, but in fact it was complex.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-complex-and-chaotic-quadrants">Understanding the Complex and Chaotic Quadrants</h3>

<p>[00:04:51] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> So that‚Äôs the next quadrant over. And that‚Äôs the one where almost all of the viewers and listeners here live in, but you don‚Äôt know it. And it‚Äôs easy to fool yourself here in the complicated quadrant. In the complex quadrant, you have a new car that no one has ever driven, or even better example, you‚Äôre a test pilot in a new airplane that has never left the wind tunnel.</p>

<p>[00:05:12] Now, the problem with a new airplane is there are so many different components, it‚Äôs ten times more involved and intricate than a Formula One car. There‚Äôs, it‚Äôs moving in three dimensions, and it has all kinds of control surfaces and things, and no one‚Äôs ever flown this thing. So there, there might be a manual that says how it‚Äôs supposed to work, nobody‚Äôs checked it, and you take the plane up, and you have to figure out what does it do when I dive steeply?</p>

<p>[00:05:32] What happens when I turn and try to, do a roll? And you find out suddenly their plane falls apart and you have to eject. So you don‚Äôt know that these are the characteristics of the airplane, and no one in the world knows. You can‚Äôt hire an expert. No one‚Äôs ever flown it before. That‚Äôs what we are normally in, in software, even though we fool ourselves that we‚Äôre in complicated.</p>

<p>[00:05:53] Now, I‚Äôll say more about that in a minute, but let me get to the final one, which is if we go all the way around chaos. Most people never encounter chaos. It would be unusual to encounter it. That is like an airplane in a tailspin. So if you just see the plane just spinning around there‚Äôs no connection to what you do with the controls.</p>

<p>[00:06:09] You pull back, you push forward, something else. What you do has no effect on the situation. All you can do, there are no rules, there is no connection. All you can do is try stuff and hope to get yourself into one of the other quadrants. So that‚Äôs unusual. Although lots of people think they‚Äôre in a chaotic situation.</p>

<p>[00:06:24] They think there aren‚Äôt any rules here. My organization is just insane and doing crazy stuff. So all I can do is put, keep my head down. But in fact, there are rules. In fact, there are things you can discover by experimentation and you can discover how your organization works. Now I can say a lot more, but how am I doing so far?</p>

<p>[00:06:43] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> That‚Äôs great. For those that are listening to the podcast, I will provide a link to this graphic so that you can see this and follow along. And if you‚Äôre watching on YouTube, you‚Äôll see that on the screen when it‚Äôs brought up. So I‚Äôm guessing that we have these four different quadrants.</p>

<p>[00:07:00] We have clear, complicated, complex, and chaotic.</p>

<p>[00:07:03] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> And by the way, Snowden keeps changing the names of them as well. You can tell that Dave and I are we‚Äôre, I‚Äôve met him. He‚Äôs a great guy. But he makes this work more intricate than it really needs to be. I call it simple. He calls it clear. He‚Äôll call it something else next week. We got the idea.</p>

<p>[00:07:16] It‚Äôs like my car. Nobody has any difficulty using it</p>

<p>[00:07:20] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> And I think what I‚Äôm hearing you say is if you‚Äôve got this clear or a simple then you‚Äôre in a pretty safe space. You‚Äôve maybe built a website for your company. If you‚Äôre getting into complicated, then maybe you‚Äôre starting to create something that‚Äôs unique, but you‚Äôre maybe pulling together other technologies that exist.</p>

<p>[00:07:39] Whereas when you get</p>

<p>[00:07:40] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> and people have done it before. That‚Äôs the crucial thing with complicated is that it‚Äôs well understood how to do it. So building a website in 1999 was a pretty complex activity. Nobody had really built an e-commerce website before, Amazon and a few others had made it, but buying stuff on the web, really not well understood 2007, eight, nine.</p>

<p>[00:07:59] I remember looking up websites that said things like so you want to add a button, we were all trying to figure out how this stuff worked in the aughts. And now we have things like Wix, we have Squarespace, we have stuff that‚Äôll just make it for us. And we all have Facebook pages and such.</p>

<p>[00:08:12] So building a website has made that full journey from Hey, nobody understands how to do this. We‚Äôre discovering the rules. They‚Äôre there, but we don‚Äôt know to complicated where you need experts. And when you hire them, they can do it for you. And now anybody can do it. It‚Äôs now moved into the simple realm.</p>

<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I would like to understand this chaotic environment and what that looks like. Also if it‚Äôs a good thing or not?</p>

<p>[00:08:34] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> It can be a good thing. Entering chaos can be tremendous for creating very new innovative ideas if you do it intentionally, if you say, all right, I‚Äôm now going to enter this domain where not only no one understands the rules, but there are no rules. And this is new and unshaped that we‚Äôre going to generate a whole bunch of new things, but we don‚Äôt know where we‚Äôre going to wind up we don‚Äôt know what outcome we‚Äôre going to get.</p>

<p>[00:08:56] Now I‚Äôm trying to think of a positive example. While I‚Äôm thinking of that I‚Äôll give you a very simple negative example. I remember being woken up at one in the morning when I was working at an e-commerce company. The same one with the 4,000 new products every week. And the, I was woken up by our hosting company and I groggily tried to figure out what was going on.</p>

<p>[00:09:12] Eventually I figured out we were under distributed denial of service. So there was so much traffic coming to our website, we‚Äôd actually knocked out the data center. So the entire hosting provider said nobody who buys our services can use their services because your website, so you better do something about it.</p>

<p>[00:09:30] I didn‚Äôt have control over it. There were things that the hosting company was doing and I more or less was an observer and I could just watch them try to filter the traffic and stop things coming in. But I, those weren‚Äôt my servers.</p>

<p>[00:09:41] There weren‚Äôt my Firewalls and so on. It was upstream from me and I could observe that our website was definitely down. Nobody could buy anything. Luckily, it was one in the morning, so we didn‚Äôt have quite so many people purchasing cheap handbags on our website. But in that circumstance, I really didn‚Äôt have any control and no action I could take would have an influence on what happened.</p>

<p>[00:10:02] Now. I‚Äôll try to come up with a positive example for you. When somebody like Pixar, really creative, really innovative movie studio gets a bunch of really clever people together in a room to come up with a new exciting movie. They really don‚Äôt have much control. The people who put them in the room can‚Äôt say we‚Äôll make sure we put this person in the room and then it‚Äôll turn out to be a cowboy movie.</p>

<p>[00:10:23] We need a Western, we‚Äôll put the Western expert in there. Because when you get really creative people with a really fantastic process, like Pixar has, they may come up with a completely different movie, not the one you expected. And that‚Äôs a good thing. So you want that disconnection between the actions and the results, when you can plan for it and you‚Äôre happy with completely different results.</p>

<p>[00:10:43] Because they‚Äôll come up with an amazing, super duper movie, but you can‚Äôt control it or say by putting these folks together in this way, we‚Äôll come out with this this result. So there‚Äôs a positive and a negative example of chaos in software, at least adjacent realms.</p>

<p>[00:10:56] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Because we deal in these complex environments and sometimes we do find ourselves shifting into this chaotic environment. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to get us ourselves out of chaotic environments very often, if it remains that way too long.</p>

<p>[00:11:13] So I‚Äôm curious, what are some of the things that we need to do to deal with burnout?</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-burnout-in-complex-environments">Dealing with Burnout in Complex Environments</h3>

<p>[00:11:19] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> Burnout is a different topic. So I‚Äôm very happy to touch on burnout. If you were to be in either of these environments without control for a long time, you would definitely get to burnout. Simple and complicated usually don‚Äôt have burnout associated. They have boredom that people get ennui, they get oh man, this is anybody could do this.</p>

<p>[00:11:37] And we got an expert here telling us what to do. Why am I here? So the kind of danger on that side of the equation is it‚Äôs just too boring and people leave if they want to be excited by new, clever things. But on the other side, you‚Äôre right. If you allow chaos to reign for a long time, people say, there‚Äôs just nothing I can do.</p>

<p>[00:11:54] The most important thing to do, especially in complex, but it also works in the chaotic environment, is to try things.</p>

<p>[00:12:01] And so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm always coaching my clients and helping people on my forum and so on to do more and more experiments and to praise results, whatever they might be. And to get their cycle time as low as possible so that the time between when you have an idea and you say, I‚Äôd like to try this experiment.</p>

<p>[00:12:18] Maybe this would improve our conversion rate. Maybe this would improve our customer satisfaction. Maybe fewer people would churn or complain to customer service. If we had this feature, you want to be able to get from that idea. To measuring that it‚Äôs a reality or not to, to sensing whether it worked or not in as fast as possible.</p>

<p>[00:12:37] I usually teach people to do that within one day.</p>

<p>[00:12:39] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> That‚Äôs a fast turnaround.</p>

<p>[00:12:41] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> It‚Äôs an extremely fast turnaround and it‚Äôs so fast that engineers and others often say well, that‚Äôs impossible. We could never do that. And I have a standing bet on my website, which I‚Äôm happy to fulfill with your listeners and viewers. If you can find something that you think couldn‚Äôt possibly be tested at that speed, please get in touch with me and I will buy you a beer if you can find one that I can‚Äôt do. I have never had to buy anyone a beer because if you work closely enough and thoroughly enough at it so that you can experiment, you get a meaningful experiment, maybe a tiny experiment, maybe the smallest possible change, but it will tell you, am I on the right track or not?</p>

<p>[00:13:17] And that‚Äôs the exploration philosophy that you need in the complex domain, which you almost certainly are in. And it‚Äôs very different from the let‚Äôs go from A to B philosophy that you have in complicated and simple where you‚Äôre simply saying, look, everybody knows how to do this, or an expert knows how to do this.</p>

<p>[00:13:31] We just have to follow the steps. This is a territory with no maps and we need to make the maps as we go.</p>

<p>[00:13:37] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<h3 id="delivering-value-through-experimentation">Delivering Value Through Experimentation</h3>

<p>[00:13:37] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Now, I‚Äôd like to explore this a little bit more because we just did a short series on delivering value within product teams. As a matter of fact, when this publishes there will have already been a person named David Pereira, who is an author of the book, Untrapped. And he postulates that a lot of teams aren‚Äôt focusing enough on delivering value to the customer. Reduce your backlog, get things off of that backlog that don‚Äôt matter.</p>

<p>[00:14:09] Rethink how you‚Äôre going to do your product in the here and now thinking about how you‚Äôre going to develop in the future, but only the short future to make sure that you are delivering value to the customer. And we‚Äôve had a few other podcasts similar to that, where we‚Äôre talking about delivering value.</p>

<p>[00:14:28] And In my mind, what you‚Äôre saying makes sense to test and validate with the customers. But we also have this drive to make sure that anything and everything we do has value. But what you said is maybe try a few different things. Now, I don‚Äôt think they fly in the face of each other, but I would like to hear your take on that.</p>

<p>[00:14:50] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> Let me use an analogy for you. And I think it‚Äôs relevant to the country you‚Äôre in. There were two guys who went and explored the center of what‚Äôs now the United States called Lewis and Clark and what happened to them at one point is there, they‚Äôre out there with their expeditionary force and they‚Äôre going through hostile territory with people who don‚Äôt like them and don‚Äôt want them there and there are bears and unknown territory and there‚Äôs no map and they come to a fork in the river.</p>

<p>[00:15:13] Part of the river goes this way and part of the river goes that way. Now, if they wanted to add the most value, their goal was to get to the headwaters of the river to get to where the river originated. If they wanted to do that in the most direct way. What they would have just done is go uphill because you‚Äôre trying to get to the top of the river.</p>

<p>[00:15:28] You want to go highest up, and so you just say, hey, look, that one‚Äôs more up than this way. We‚Äôre going to go that way. And if you have a map, if you have knowledge of the territory, if you know exactly how things work, if you‚Äôre in the complicated domain, that‚Äôs the right thing to do. Hey, let‚Äôs look at the map.</p>

<p>[00:15:44] Let‚Äôs get our GPS. Let‚Äôs figure out what‚Äôs here. They‚Äôre the ones drawing the map. They don‚Äôt know, and it is impossible for them to know. What you need to be doing in this circumstance is what Lewis and Clark did, which is to try different experiments. So they took little groups of three from where they were at the fork in the river, where they didn‚Äôt know what the right direction was.</p>

<p>[00:16:02] Maybe not to follow the river at all. Maybe they should hike for a while. They didn‚Äôt know that, so they sent out little groups, and the groups went out for a couple hours to climb local hills and see what they could see around them and figure out, should we go this way or that way? They came back.</p>

<p>[00:16:14] It wasn‚Äôt clear. So that experiment of sending people out gave them a little more information, but not enough to decide we‚Äôre going to take this fork or the other fork. That‚Äôs okay. That was a good result. They celebrated that. Say great, good job folks. You found out this and that you found out we shouldn‚Äôt go that way for sure.</p>

<p>[00:16:28] That‚Äôs definitely wrong. And now we‚Äôre going to do more. So they narrowed it down to two possible directions and they sent out a larger force one way and a larger force the other way. And a few folks stayed back at base. And a couple of days later, now that they‚Äôd explored more. They came back and it became very clear that one fork was the better one.</p>

<p>[00:16:43] It wasn‚Äôt the one that was more obvious. Most of the people in the group thought we should go down one fork, because it looked better. It looked more like the rest of the river that they were following. The other one said, this one‚Äôs headed in the right direction, and you‚Äôve explored it far enough that I think we‚Äôre going to find a waterfall there, and we‚Äôre going to see that the water drops a lot.</p>

<p>[00:17:00] That‚Äôs what they found a few days later. They found Missouri Falls. And they were able to continue. So this is the story of decision point. If you want to go look this up, it‚Äôs a wonderful story. You can go visit the location and see what they did. The point of the whole story is they did experiments that did work, but give them negative results.</p>

<h3 id="the-value-of-negative-results">The Value of Negative Results</h3>

<p>[00:17:16] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> And those negative results were really valuable, and they increased the value of Lewis and Clark‚Äôs eventual map and that their progress, of course, toward the West Coast, which is what they were trying to get to. Had they not done those experiments, they would have produced less value, even though each individual experiment produced negative value.</p>

<p>[00:17:33] He‚Äôs don‚Äôt go this way, bears this direction, right? Wrong way. Don‚Äôt go this way. That‚Äôs useful data. And the danger is that far too often we fool ourselves into thinking there is a right way. We know the right way. We can consult the experts. We can find it out. And therefore we want to punish people who don‚Äôt follow the right way.</p>

<h3 id="challenging-the-concept-of-best-practices">Challenging the Concept of Best Practices</h3>

<p>[00:17:50] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> So this, for example, is why I outlaw with all my clients the phrase best practices. I say, you do not know what the best practices are. There is no chance that you could possibly know that. So stop talking about it. What we want to talk about is incremental value. How are we showing that we are headed in the right direction, which may mean going down the valley before we go up the hill.</p>

<p>[00:18:08] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> That‚Äôs a great way of describing it. Thank you very much for that. I think that was a really great story and a way to clearly articulate that we are still delivering value, even if some of the things that we thought we were going to do are even just thrown out when we, and we do, we go another way.</p>

<p>[00:18:25] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> Yes.</p>

<h3 id="explaining-failures-to-clients">Explaining Failures to Clients</h3>

<p>[00:18:26] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> And one of the hardest things to do, and you need really good account managers for this, is to explain to your client why that‚Äôs good. Hey folks, we just tried a thing and it was a miserable failure. It definitely didn‚Äôt work. Now, aren‚Äôt we so happy? Your client says, my god, I just wasted, a week‚Äôs worth of development time on this thing.</p>

<p>[00:18:40] Why don‚Äôt you guys build the right thing? So you really need to explain that carefully to the person who is paying the salaries, or else they‚Äôre going to cut you off and try to find an expert, and only when they can‚Äôt find one will they discover, oh, that exploration, that was right.</p>

<h3 id="embracing-complexity-in-innovation">Embracing Complexity in Innovation</h3>

<p>[00:18:53] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Now, we did title this podcast, living in a world of complexity, and we talked about the Cynefin framework and you‚Äôre talking a lot about complexity. So I guess I should ask you this question because I didn‚Äôt upfront, is this the world that you believe that teams should be working in?</p>

<p>[00:19:14] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> Yes, absolutely. For the reason I was alluding to before. Which is that it‚Äôs boring. It‚Äôs not so interesting to be in the simple or the complicated domain. So the very best folks are not going to stay there. A couple of folks have just, as we‚Äôre recording this, have just left OpenAI.</p>

<p>[00:19:29] And I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre going to do, but they‚Äôre doing some very interesting ideas and new stuff because this territory is starting to get conquered. We‚Äôre starting to understand how ChatGPT and all its friends actually work. And to get a handle on it, get some manuals, get some ideas about what good practices are.</p>

<p>[00:19:45] I think you can get a degree in prompt engineering now. If you can‚Äôt, you will be able to soon. This territory is getting pacified and getting understood and mapped much more quickly than it might have done in the past. And I think it is really important for organizations as a whole to not be afraid of complexity.</p>

<p>[00:20:03] We‚Äôre going to enter this area. We‚Äôre going to explore it. The reason there‚Äôs value in it is because other people haven‚Äôt discovered it. If we were to just go build yet another e commerce website, if we were to just go, SpaceX just kept building Saturn five rockets, That would not be a very valuable company.</p>

<p>[00:20:18] That would not be we wouldn‚Äôt have Starlink, and maybe we‚Äôll finally get to send Elon Musk to Mars, and I hope he stays there when he gets there. We would not have all the progress that SpaceX is making. What they‚Äôre doing is, as we‚Äôre recording this, they‚Äôre blowing up rockets every few weeks, but they keep going farther, right?</p>

<p>[00:20:34] Those are successful experiments with negative results that tell SpaceX, yeah, this part of the rocket works. The part that blew up? Not so good. Don‚Äôt do that one. And they are making huge progress very quickly, precisely because they‚Äôre entering the complex domain and somebody who‚Äôs just sitting back, Boeing has not been nearly as innovative as them and they‚Äôre four years behind because not that they‚Äôre having doors fall off airplanes, which is also happening to them, but their space exploration has just been much more by the book.</p>

<p>[00:21:01] They‚Äôve operated much more in the complicated domain. They‚Äôre behind. They‚Äôre not as innovative. They‚Äôre probably not going to get to Mars first.</p>

<h3 id="signs-youre-not-in-the-complex-domain">Signs You‚Äôre Not in the Complex Domain</h3>

<p>[00:21:07] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> What are some signs that you are not living in that world of complexity?</p>

<p>[00:21:12] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> So that‚Äôs the must much less frequent mistake. Let‚Äôs make sure we talk about the other mistake, which is much, much more common, which is to think you‚Äôre in complicated when you‚Äôre actually in complex but the mistake you refer to also happens where somebody thinks, great, we need to be super innovative.</p>

<p>[00:21:26] We need to come up with new, amazing, super duper stuff here. And in fact, somebody will hire me to come along and review it. And I‚Äôll say, you could buy this. There‚Äôs no reason why you should be building this software because this is actually a solved problem. This is much more egregious, but more memorable for your listeners, but you can map to all kinds of things where people are typically the error is to build where you could buy, where you‚Äôre doing not invented here. And you say, we can do it better. The most extreme example of this is that somebody came to me. And said, Squirrel, I want to tell you about my amazing new startup.</p>

<p>[00:21:59] We‚Äôve spent years working on this. We have really clever people. We‚Äôve invented this fantastic technology. It‚Äôs really going to revolutionize mobile devices. I said, great. I have a phone. This is when phones were relatively new. iPhones were still a kind of nifty novelty. And I said I got one, so what, show me what does it do?</p>

<p>[00:22:16] It turned out that what it boiled down to, they had fancy words for it, but what it boiled down to us is that you could select some text from one app. And then you could cut that text and you could paste it into another app. I said, I hate to tell you, iOS now has that. Apple beat you to it. And you know what?</p>

<p>[00:22:33] It‚Äôs kind of commodity stuff. You don‚Äôt have anything special here. And then the poor guy I was telling this to, just his face fell. He was really depressed. Once he figured out that what he built was basically cut and paste. With fancy names for it. Now there‚Äôs a good ending to the story. There‚Äôs a silver lining, which is once I kind of woke him up to that, he figured out some other things he could do to make sure that he was manipulating texts in a better way, had some security Aspects to it and he specialized into an area where he actually did have something innovative where it actually was complex But he hadn‚Äôt noticed that this was pretty well understood that it was something I could do on my phone without needing his fancy special software and therefore he was going to have no customers whatsoever.</p>

<h3 id="the-danger-of-not-testing-innovations">The Danger of Not Testing Innovations</h3>

<p>[00:23:13] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> Of course what he hadn‚Äôt been doing was to test all the way along. He hadn‚Äôt been going quickly around the cycle of probe, sense, respond of try something, get customer feedback, and then continue because the first customer would have said, I can already do that. Why would I need one of those? He hadn‚Äôt done that.</p>

<p>[00:23:28] He‚Äôd done it in secret. And that‚Äôs one of the dangers that leads you into this realm. So if you‚Äôre operating in that way, if you‚Äôre saying to yourself, we have new innovative stuff, it‚Äôs better than everyone else in the world. And you haven‚Äôt tested it. You haven‚Äôt gone out to actual customers and checked it.</p>

<p>[00:23:42] Red flag, danger, stop everything you‚Äôre doing. Go and check that with customers because you may be in the complex domain. You may be operating where you need to explore and make decisions like Lewis and Clark, but maybe not, maybe this is well known or not desired. Then you should try something else.</p>

<p>[00:23:57] So that‚Äôs the mistake that direction</p>

<p>[00:23:59] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yeah, I can see that. And I think if we were to go into your average company meeting where, you have the leader of a team and we‚Äôre sitting down, I can‚Äôt tell you how many times this happens and this is nothing against the teams. It‚Äôs just something that you have to really think about and almost embed into your process.</p>

<p>[00:24:20] Is, very often I‚Äôll sit with these teams and they‚Äôll say, yeah, the, we‚Äôve rolled this feature out, is there on our backlog? We got it out to the customer.</p>

<p>[00:24:30] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> after months of effort, we had the whole team where we had different people working the back end, the front end, the data scientists, everyone did the designs were beautiful. And,</p>

<p>[00:24:37] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> and do we know if the customers like it? And sometimes we don‚Äôt ask that question. Sometimes that gets lost in there and we find out very quickly when the customer doesn‚Äôt like it. And that‚Äôs when you have to unravel and say, oh we just kind of rolled out the feature. We had lots of meetings to talk about it.</p>

<p>[00:24:55] So we figured we nailed it, but we never actually gave it to the customer to truly test it because that would slow things down.</p>

<p>[00:25:03] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> There‚Äôs a worse outcome.</p>

<h3 id="encouraging-frequent-customer-feedback">Encouraging Frequent Customer Feedback</h3>

<p>[00:25:04] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> And I see this very frequently, nobody ever tests. So they get the feature out, they celebrate, they have the pizza party, they have the exciting, they release, they go to the all hands meeting, they say, wonderful, new feature, excellent, version two, it‚Äôs so stupendous, and nobody ever checks with the customers, and so they never actually find out that they wasted their time, and they think, great, now it‚Äôs time for the next one, and the amount of money you can waste on this is why it‚Äôs so easy for me to help tech teams be insanely profitable.</p>

<p>[00:25:28] Because they‚Äôre so unprofitable when they do this. And so undoing this is something actually engineers know how to do. Engineers know how to release frequently, how to get frequent feedback from customers. They just don‚Äôt believe anybody wants them to do it. Once I can get them doing that, they often discover that they have wasted huge amounts of effort on things that nobody actually wanted and that they didn‚Äôt check.</p>

<p>[00:25:47] So they actually never knew it. They thought they‚Äôd had a great success and they don‚Äôt.</p>

<p>[00:25:51] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yeah. And it does take leadership to, if you will, I don‚Äôt know if allow is the right word, but to enable that behavior to let</p>

<p>[00:25:59] people know wrong as bad is okay.</p>

<p>[00:26:02] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> We want to get the negative answer. And in fact, if you‚Äôre a good scientist, you bias away from the answer you want. If you want to prove that apples fall down when you drop them, you make sure that, it‚Äôs a particularly light apple and it‚Äôs the, a day when their gravity is light or something, you‚Äôve done something so that the experiment is biased away from your result.</p>

<p>[00:26:20] And only if, every time I drop the apple, it still falls down. Okay, now I know that gravity operates downward. You want to do the same kind of thing with your experiments. You want to bias away from customers liking it, bias away from it being a successful result. Because that way, you‚Äôre even more certain that it‚Äôs going to work correctly for you.</p>

<h3 id="designing-effective-experiments">Designing Effective Experiments</h3>

<p>[00:26:39] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> What are some things that I can go back with my team to start doing today?</p>

<p>[00:26:44] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> And I‚Äôll come to the other direction, the much more frequent error as a way of answering your question. So you brought me onto it perfectly. Thank you. The most frequent error is that you think you‚Äôre in the complicated domain, because we‚Äôre engineered, our brains evolved, so that we thought we can think that the universe is ordered, that things are working the way we expect.</p>

<p>[00:27:03] We form theories, and then we believe that the world works according to our theories. Inconveniently, it often doesn‚Äôt, and things surprise us but they surprise us because our brains are wired to think, I‚Äôm in the complicated domain. I understand this. I‚Äôm in the simple domain. There, there‚Äôs a set of steps I can follow that will make sense here, but you‚Äôre not.</p>

<p>[00:27:22] And if you think, that your software is simple, that your software is known and well understood. And you‚Äôre just doing something again that you‚Äôve done many times before. It is very likely that belief is catastrophically false. And you can find out very quickly whether it is false or not.</p>

<p>[00:27:38] You can undo that assumption by doing some experiments. And you want to do those experiments quickly, you‚Äôd want to try, just like Lewis and Clark sent out the little parties to go all around and North, South, East, West, everybody try go look around to see what‚Äôs here. You would want to do very quick experiments, which means getting into production fast.</p>

<p>[00:27:56] It means doing things like continuous integration, continuous deployment, all the tools your engineers know how to do so that you can get that experimental data very quickly. And you can rapidly prove whether the path you are following the next five sprints or the next 20 sprints that you‚Äôve laid out in your roadmap are actually taking you toward a good outcome or a catastrophically bad one.</p>

<p>[00:28:17] So design experiments that let you shortcut that. Hey folks, what I‚Äôm going to do is I‚Äôm going to give you the report. And it‚Äôll have no data in it. What on earth good would that be? If you got a report with no data in it, but the columns are there, you could check if the right columns are there.</p>

<p>[00:28:30] These columns are all wrong. Why are you working so hard to get all this data that we don‚Äôt need? Oh, that‚Äôs interesting. I had one report somebody asked for, and I calculated that the, if it was printed out, which is what they wanted to do, it would form a stack that was taller than the building we were in.</p>

<p>[00:28:45] And it would take human beings at least one year to read all the data in the report. And I said, do you really want this report? They said now that you tell us that, maybe not. Maybe we could do something else. It turned out they wanted analyses. They didn‚Äôt want the report. That kind of experiment where you can find out from your customers much more quickly whether you‚Äôre on the right track will tell you very fast whether the path you think you‚Äôre following, the best practice, the complicated process that your experts are telling you to follow is actually complicated or do you actually almost certainly live in the complex domain. You‚Äôre building something that‚Äôs never been built before.</p>

<p>[00:29:18] You need to be much more experimental. And then the great news is there‚Äôs wonderful things you can do there. We have fantastic tools that allow us to go through really fast cycle times. Even for my biotech customers where they‚Äôre building medical devices that have massive consequences, people cut off parts of their bodies.</p>

<p>[00:29:33] If these things give the wrong result, I get them releasing every two weeks. So if they can do that, surely you can release your e-commerce product, your finance product, something like that. You can get feedback from your customers every day. And if you can do that, when you‚Äôre operating in the complex domain, the profit is huge and the orientation you get, the mapping that happened, that goes on is so much faster than any of your competition, you‚Äôre going to be way out ahead.</p>

<p>[00:29:57] That‚Äôs the sort of thing you can do. Design those experiments, make sure you have the process in place that allows you to run those experiments very quickly and praise people when they do experiments that have both positive, good outcomes until you go this way. And the ones that say, here be dragons, bears, don‚Äôt go this way.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-examples-of-experimentation">Real-World Examples of Experimentation</h3>

<p>[00:30:13] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> I have a really good example of that. I was working with a group of scientists and they, these are labs, beakers and things like that in the</p>

<p>[00:30:20] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> room.</p>

<p>[00:30:21] I know that world. Yeah,</p>

<p>[00:30:22] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yeah. And we had this need to put labels on these beakers. And so we were actually building some software that was collecting the data for the the studies that they were doing and all that good stuff.</p>

<p>[00:30:34] But one little tiny piece of this that we‚Äôre going to roll out to all of the scientific community around the world in this very large company was to print labels. And so we were like we‚Äôre going to get those thermal label printers because they just print out the, the perfect size.</p>

<p>[00:30:49] You just wrap it around the beaker and we tested it. The team was sitting there like trying it out. It, it printed out the formulas and things like that. All these special characters that were needed and</p>

<p>[00:30:59] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> great to you. Your experts told you this works great. This is the path. We already have the thermal printers. Everything‚Äôs great. What went wrong?</p>

<p>[00:31:06] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Then it goes into the lab and I don‚Äôt know if you know how a thermal printer works, but it uses heat to print. And so when you put the label onto an actual beaker with warm liquid, it turns black and you don‚Äôt get a label.</p>

<p>[00:31:19] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> Fantastic. And if you had done the experiment by printing one label by hand and putting it on one beaker, you would have found out very quickly whether that works or not. Can I tell you just one more story? Do we</p>

<p>[00:31:29] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Sure, please.</p>

<p>[00:31:30] <strong>Douglas Squirrel:</strong> There are many stories like this, but this is one of my favorites.</p>

<p>[00:31:34] Airbnb is called Airbnb, because they walked around, the two guys who started it, they walked around with air mattresses, literally things you blow up, and they went to people‚Äôs doors, they would follow somebody else into a block of flats, big high rise apartment building. And they would go around knock on the doors.</p>

<p>[00:31:52] A lot of people didn‚Äôt answer their doors. A lot more people said, you guys are nuts. Why are you walking around here with an air mattress, but a few people said, that conference happening on the road. Yeah, I under I know about that. And I‚Äôd be happy to have somebody stay in my front room and they say, here‚Äôs the air mattress.</p>

<p>[00:32:07] And then they hadn‚Äôt built any software. They would just write down the person‚Äôs name and they would go back to a spreadsheet where they had advertised, come stay for this conference and they would match up the people. So they did this completely without technology, right? Hardly anything, basically pieces of paper and spreadsheets and things.</p>

<p>[00:32:24] Nothing fancy. And they discovered that, in fact, people wanted to do this. But they could very easily have discovered, and they would have been very happy to discover, that nobody would want to do this, and it was a completely insane business idea, because then they could do something else to try to solve the problem that they were working on.</p>

<p>[00:32:38] And I‚Äôm sure they tried some others that we don‚Äôt know about, that didn‚Äôt work out so well. That kind of experimentation is exactly what you need. And it‚Äôs exactly what you could have been doing with your thermal printer and your beakers to, to try it by hand with no technology and say does this actually work?</p>

<p>[00:32:53] Can I use it in a lab? Aha. No. Let‚Äôs here are dragons. Let‚Äôs go somewhere else.</p>

<p>[00:32:58] <strong>Bill Raymond:</strong> Exactly. Yeah. Those are great examples. Douglas Squirrel.</p>
